991778,"the united states legal standard applied to vaccines defines them as ""unavoidably unsafe products that are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use"". the reason why vaccines are unsafe, or in other words harmful, is that they are made up of chemicals and other elements that are poisonous to the body.  some of these chemicals and elements include formaldehyde, which is commonly used to embalm corpses and is a known carcinogen (capable of causing cancer), thiomersal, a derivative of mercury which is a toxic heavy metal, and aluminum phosphate which is a toxin used in deodorants. other toxic ingredients include phenol (carbolic acid), alum (a preservative), and acetone which is a volatile solvent and a deadly poison used in fingernail polish remover.  vaccines contain not only poisonous chemicals but also foreign proteins such as chick embryo, calf serum, rabbit brain tissue and monkey kidney cells. these foreign proteins can trigger numerous allergic and inflammatory reactions and can produce anaphylactic shock in susceptible infants.  when these enter your bloodstream your body will take immediate action to eliminate these poisons either through the normal organs of elimination or through acute reactions such as fever, swelling or skin rashes. as long as these latter reactions are not suppressed through drugs, it is possible for the body to eliminate these vaccine poisons thereby ensuring that no long-term damage will occur.  however, should the body have insufficient vitality to mount an eliminative reaction, or should the eliminative reaction (fever, swelling, skin rash) be suppressed with drugs, then the vaccine poisons will be retained within the body's tissues.",0,,

879601,"you have (certain) freedom to say something, but if someone else doesn't agree they're allowed to dv you. however, you're not allowed, at least here, to trample on other people's feelings. this is not a public forum and there are house rules.  i think where it hurts is that people with disabilities or who know disabled people know that it's important to understand and talk about things important to them. everyone is going to disagree, but people do feel hurt or offended by insensitive portrayals of disability (such as 'disabled people are only there to teach the able-bodied a lesson'; 'disabled people are objects of scorn or pity'; 'disabled people are defective or incomplete' and so on). i don't find it offensive to suggest that some blind people might want a cure and some won't, but a lot of people have made a lot of good points about reinforcing a stigma against being blind or whatever that you can only really appreciate if you've spent time disabled or with a chronic illness.  society moves on not because people ignore other people's concerns but because people take notice. my husband was diagnosed with stage iv renal cancer two years ago (after an op in 2015 left him with one kidney and a six monthly cancer screening routine) and for most of his remaining life had a real disability. we are lucky to live in a society where not only could he access things like buses while in a wheelchair or sit in a cafe, but that people understood his difficulties and didn't treat him as inferior or subhuman because he was in a wheelchair or couldn't wear normal socks and shoes because of swollen feet.  but that tends to come when people speak up for their rights and tell people what's offensive and what isn't, rather than staying quiet.  additionally, being wilfully provocative is fine in some circumstances when you're 'speaking truth to power'. but when you are attacking or belittling or mocking people who are less well off than yourself, or using their conditions as insults (e.g. 'retarded' rather than 'stupid'; in the uk 'spaz', coming from 'spastic', is considered a slur) then you cross a line from provocative to crude. and crudeness doesn't move society on in terms of addressing the issues art should address, nor is it somehow daring -- it's just blunt and regressive and often a smokescreen for people not wanting to change how they see people with disabilities, chronic illnesses or conditions that affect their perception of the world.  while many of us would prefer not to be disabled -- and that's where there is a legitimate disagreement -- some people find that their conditions have helped them see the world from a different perspective. i know that i now view the world *much* differently than if i'd never witnessed someone i love go through cancer. i miss my husband like crazy and wish no-one had to experience it, but i feel that there's very little that can really frighten me any more and that i can build on my experiences and do things in his name. i actually proposed to him the day he got his initial 'your kidney is basically a tumour so we'll need to whip it out', but we were well on the way to marriage at that point -- i just needed to pop the question, oh, and it was a leap year anyway so as a woman i was allowed to propose...  it will never be the same as if he had never got ill, though. there's not a day goes by when i don't feel like there's a gaping hole in my heart. he's never coming back from work; i'm never going to come in from work to find him relaxing on the sofa watching cricket and eating crisps. if you told me that a priest could do a ritual and have his ashes magically reform into a living human being again, too damn right i'd say yes.   furthermore, *my own* life would have been very different, and much better, if i hadn't had lifeshattering depression and psychosis in my twenties. i take pills for anxiety. if there were pills for dyspraxia and autism i'd take that in a heartbeat. many wouldn't, and that's fine -- and there's a discussion to be had on where people with disabilities feel that they would take a cure if offered and where they wouldn't. even with cancer, there comes a time where you have to discuss with yourself and others where the point of no return has arrived. i told my husband from day 1 he wasn't to keep himself going just because he was afraid what would happen to me. in his last week, he saw a counsellor and a priest then accepted that he needed hospital care and may not come out of hospital. he died in a hospice a week later after a relaxed afternoon with me, one of his oldest friends and my dad sat around laughing and nattering about war of the worlds. he was brave to admit, later that night, that there was nothing more left and check out. i was relieved that, in the physical state he was in, he didn't struggle through the night just to see me again. i left him with a kiss that i will taste for the rest of my life.  it is probably very brave to accept either a lifelong condition such as being blind or deaf or autistic and embracing the perspective it gives you rather than seeking a cure or aids to give you assistance. i have nothing against that perspective; i don't share it, but i at least *understand* it. i fully support people's rights not to be cured and understand completely that many conditions are incurable. society has gone a long way in my own lifetime -- even since i've been an adult -- to recognise and support disabled people as needing support, adaptations and empowerment, as well as freedom from discrimination.  but it's not ok to sit back and not do anything to understand other people's perspectives or why offending or hurting someone is a bad thing in many circumstances. understanding where it's ok to offend and where it isn't makes you a better artist, not a worse one.  i'm invoking my mod voice here and saying that i'm locking this subthread. it's a line of discussion that has run its course and the above is not up for debate.",1,,2

354704,"**beginning**  i started studying lucid dreaming a few years ago after hearing about it some where. i became a member on dreamviews and began reading more and more about lucid dreaming. i started my first dream journal around that time. after a few days, i had my first lucid dream. it was short and i didn't do much, but i wanted to get better.  now that i had my first lucid dream, i began to study more and more. all of my internet time was dedicated to reading about lucid dream induction techniques, keywords/terms, reality checks, etc. i spent a lot of my time reading other dreamers' dream journals and their lucid dreaming experiences. they kept me interested in lucid dreaming so i wouldn't give up.  **dream journaling**  after my first month, i was able to have one, short lucid dream a week or even two if i was lucky. i kept up with my dream journal and did reality checks through out the day. my normal dreams weren't very detailed and they were short.  as i kept writing in it over the past year, my dreams were long and took up two pages sometimes. they were very clear, vivid, and movie-like. while i was dreaming, perception of dream time was noticeable. for example, if the plot of a dream lasted a dream day, my mind made it feel   it had been a day. it didn't actually feel like a day passed, it was more like when someone asks what you did today, you tell them from when you got up and what you did from that point until now. you're going through each event that leads up to present time, but you aren't experiencing it. my longer lucid dreams feel like this. it's kind of hard for me to explain.  **lucid dream experiences**  after two years, i started having lucid dreams at least 5 times a week. they would last around 10 seconds to maybe 10 minutes. now, after 5 years, my dreams can last up to 30+ minutes when i use deild to get back into a lucid dream after waking (i can only guess how long a lucid dream lasts). vividness ranged from cloudy to extremely realistic, but control was always a problem for me. my first problems of control was over my dream body. i had trouble running fast and sometimes couldn't see. i found that when i ran on all fours, i would run much faster. i also took a liking to shapeshifting in dreams around this time. so whenever i wanted to run fast, i would transform into a wolf or a cheetah. i don't have problems running on just two anymore, but i still run on all fours every once in a while because it's fun.  i had trouble flying for the longest time too. at first, the best i could do was a huge jump and soar for a little bit before crash landing. earlier this year, i realized the way i learned how to run faster was to transform into something that can run fast. in one lucid dream i had, i was stuck in a creepy lab where some crazy scientists were doing experiments on people and i wanted to get away. i didn't want to confront the scientists so i transformed into an eastern dragon and flew through the ceiling. now when i fly, i transform into an eastern dragon. it became easier to fly (sometimes) and the feeling of having a long body feels really strange, but it's one of the reasons why i prefer transforming into an eastern dragon other than the western kind.   in one of the first lucid dreams i've had, i began looking for my dream guide. one of my first experiences with dream characters wasn't pleasant. i was calling for my dream guide and i hear a voice tell me to turn around. when i did, a man tackled me and put into a headlock. there were two other guys with him and they just laugh and leave me there. i was confused of what just happened, so i sat there for a while thinking about what to do next.  in another lucid dream, i met dream character that was dressed in a hooded, black robe and he said that he knew who my dream guide was. a few days later, i had a regular dream where he introduced himself and told me to call him pj. he had short, red hair and was wearing some sort of uniform. he told me he was part of an organization and he took me to its headquarters once, but i don't remember what they do. pj became a common part of my lucid and non-lucid dreams.  a few weeks later in a different lucid dream, i start calling for pj, but a with black hair shows up. i tell him that he's not pj and he says that his name is also pj. when the pj i knew showed up, he and the black haired pj started hanging out. the black haired pj became friends with red haired pj and they would both show up when i called for either of them. after a while, i asked if they can change their names for me. red haired pj is now know as jacob and black haired pj is michael. the last time i saw them, michael had joined jacob's organization and was wearing their uniform. i haven't seen them in a long time because of having less lucid dreams, but i'm sure that once i start having them regularly again, i will begin to see them more often.  i met my dream guide by summoning a door and saying i will meet my dream guide when i go through it. i entered a room that had three dogs in it, two were german shepherds and one looked like a bermese mountain dog. the shepherds were very friendly and the other dog began speaking to me. i asked it if it was my dream guide and it said yes. the dog transformed into a woman with long, curly, brown hair. i don't remember much about her other than that she told me her name was ann and that she was very nice. the two german shepherds also transformed into humans, but i don't remember them. then suddenly, the walls break apart and a large, flying machine zaps her with some sort of lightning transfer beam. a man's voice comes from the machine and tells me that he was taking her. jacob was disappointed that i didn't do anything to help her. i think i had a non-lucid dream where jacob, michael, and i rescue her from the man inside the machine, but i don't remember much of it. one thing i remember from the dream though was that jacob and ann was in a relationship.  **nightmares**  after about three years, i started getting lucid nightmares where i couldn't do anything. my lack of control along with in-dream sleep paralysis began to make lucid dreaming scary instead of fun. after a while, i wanted to quit lucid dreaming all together. i stopped writing in my dream journal and stopped encouraging myself to have lucid dreams. after about a year, my recall slowly dropped to where it was in the beginning and i rarely lucid dreamed at all.  i'm getting back into lucid dreaming now because i'm not afraid to take on the scary stuff anymore. i'm trying to get back into writing in my dream journal, but i'm being lazy about it. i'm starting to get lucid dreams again at about one every other day by dilding and using deild when i can. my control has gotten better because i realized that imagination is extremely important when you want something to work in dreams. so when i imagine something to happen, it happens. right now i'm working on achieving lucid dreams as often as i used to and get better control over my lucid dreams.",0,,

they don‚Äôt. why? because the author looks at a lame leg as just a thing you drag, and treats the cane lie a decoration. they never write the character struggling on stairs, not able to sit at a table because they can‚Äôt bend the leg to sit in the chair, sleeping on the floor because they can‚Äôt lift their leg up high enough to climb up into a bed. they don‚Äôt write those things, because they have no clue that someone with a cane does those things, because they never had to live with a lame leg.  that‚Äôs where the problem of undisabled writing disabled comes in. granted, they mean well and are trying to be inclusive and all, but they have never lived with that kind of disability so they have no clue how big of an impact something like that has on your life.",1,0,1

995977,"right, i had this book recommended to me before  i'm not giving up on mutou, biffe, usually people stop at this point. if you want to continue,,,  1)  **nh school and many other special needs school's aim is not to create 'useful members of society'.**   so they aim to hold them in place? that's a claim of an onlooker.   i've worked in a special school where students had epilepsy, cerebral palsy, speech disorders, cognitive and psychological issues. luckily, they were all mild or a bit worse than mild forms.  we understood where we can really get the student to achieve and where we will report on paper that s/he deserves a good mark, while in reality s/he has no way oof doing so.  for instance, a student from grade 3, speech disorder. he only pronounces the beginning syllables of the words and you ask him trying to guess what he says.  'bo-boo-bo' - bunker?  'boo-boo' - bomb?  'y-y-ya'  i can't give him a b, but the higher-ups demand that he takes a test that he'll be able to pass only 4-5 years later, at best. what do i do? yes, i give him a d, knowing that i can slowly guide him in the next years and the bueraucratic idiots can dance at the high rates the school is reporting. while you might regard me as slacking off and not giving shit.   2)  **if the schools baby the special needs students, in the real world these students would fall apart, not being able to handle themselves.**   probably you can clarify what 'babying' we are talking about? you explained it as ""treat you special""   there are students with sen who have cognitive abilities and those who don't.  if a kid can't hold a pen to write due to tremor, and i take his wrist and stabilize it, while he's jotting down equations, am i 'babying' him?  if a kid with asd gets easily distracted and we count with her using fingers, am i 'babying' her?  a healthy person thinks in terms 'i can solve 10 math problems in 10 minutes so a disabled can!' nope, e.g. blind students take longer to take in what's in front of them. higher-ups say 'just give them braille books!' even then they need additional time, because they process more slowly.  \------------  above, i left the documents that outlawed discrimination based on disability principle. these regulations ascertain that i don't give special treaatment to students, i can never lower expectations, give favorable marks when they don't deserve. the brass reminds us about that every chance they get.  so i have trouble agreeing that we even have a possibility of 'treating students special' and given the american penchant for suing on discrimination charges... in my country students complain to parents, who whip us via the principal  3) **yamaku wants to make productive members whereas other schools don't. this is what mutou is trying to say.**  if that's what he meant, he's a real moron. i don't know a school that would state that on its official site 'our mission is to leech your money.' or 'turn your kids in to our concentration camp'.   however, if he as a science teacher wanted to help students,why are his lectures so tedious?   i never majored in science, but my science teachers did their best to involve us at school. that's not history class, or english-french whatever  \--------------------------------  i was trying to point out a text lapse or logical fallacy:  even if mutou views himself as a righteous teacher, he can't say that catering to the needs is restricted to technology and 1 floor. teaching is interaction first of all, in any kind of education. and if you are worried that yamaku has no elevator, it's a common practice to assign students with motor dysfunction to classrooms on the 1st floor. there are rails for lilly, rules on canteen motion, rules on running in corridors, yamaku in reality covers everything.  on the other hand making productive members is a part of catering to the needs of students. how can you teach something that students won't need? making drugs like in breaking bad?  4) **i think mutou means instead of the staff being laid back, the staff tries to help the students live a normal life in yamaku, get treated normally, and learn how to live in the real world with their handicap. ... hence, yamaku students wouldn't go straight to a hospital after they graduate, but new hope students would, because they aren't use to life without special treatment.**   how are staff attitudes related to health condition?  you can treat hisao all you want, but if his heart starts to dysfunction, he will die in your hands  see, if doctors hadn't said ok, he wouldn't have even left the hospital.   how can teachers' attitudes afffect health? if mutou brings a guitar and starts teaching shizune every day, will she hear a plane roar over hear head after graduating?  5) **many schools often don't teach real-life skills**   neither do some universities and colleges. what is more, the vicious circle 'no experience-no job' and vice versa  depending on your major, when you graduate and start working, on your first day you might hear: 'forget what you've learned at university, learning starts now!'",1,,2

254512,"**i wanna clear up a few things here.**  many people who identify as deaf consider themselves to be in a linguistic minority, rather than ""impaired"" or ""disabled."" the sense of militancy you noticed some deaf people have typically stems from lifelong ridicule by peers and neglect from parents who, if they are able to learn a shaky simulacrum of asl, reserve its use only for communicating directly with their deaf child. can you imagine if, every night at the dinner table, your parents and hearing siblings joked and laughed with each other, and whenever you asked ""what did he say? what's so funny?"" they told you, ""oh you wouldn't understand"" or ""i'll tell you later"" or ""i don't know how to say it to you.""   on top of that, you feel like a normal, intelligent being, but receive pity for the way that you are from strangers who make constant assumptions about your incompetence and ignorance. if you try to gesture or sign to a cashier or clerk, they wave their hands in your face obnoxiously and move their mouths really slowly as if your problem is stupidity. deafness is certainly a disability in american culture, but more because of the language barrier than for the inability to hear, yet otherwise reasonable people believe it's acceptable to view people just as intelligent, just as human as inferior and deserving of pity but never equality. it is a systematic and acceptable oppression that is even worse because often instead of hatred or scorn, the emotion evoked is pity and paternalism.  if you bust your ass to excel at a given field, you still face perpetual discrimination from companies who won't hire you due to the perception you'll be impossible to communicate with and also the additional cost of hiring an interpreter when necessary. you go to job interviews with an interpreter who likely makes more money than you do and might not be very good at the job, since qualifications and certifications are not required except in legal interpreting and sometimes in education.  since your parents likely sign poorly, your first exposure to language comes very late, at perhaps age 4 or 5, and your language acquisition is already stunted. worse yet, your teachers are typically interpreters, not native signers, and since they are working in elementary schools, they are often less skilled interpreters who give you a poor language model that cripples your self-expression and ability to think in language during your formative years. since there is no consistent model for deaf education, there are several ways that deaf children are systematically deprived of language. many older people were forced by parents into strictly oral schools, to attempt to learn spoken english only, a language their senses could not perceive. there was a longstanding (and wrong-headed) notion that learning english and asl simultaneously would impair a child's ability to learn english, so parents were taught to forbid their child to sign. when deaf children would be caught signing at the deaf institutes, they would be punished; for example i knew a deaf man whose teacher made him hold his arms straight out at his sides, a heavy book in each hand, for the remainder of his class, for daring to attempt communication in a way that felt natural to him.  ""deaf"" is what a person who identifies culturally with other deaf people calls themselves. the lower case ""deaf"" is a pathological view of deafness as a medical hearing loss. **when someone identifies themselves as deaf, it has very little to do with whether they were deaf from birth or how much hearing loss they have.** it is an acceptance of the culture of deafness, which is a culture, rooted in a common language that is unlike any spoken language in several of its features.  it is a language that is high context compared to many others, a culture that is collectivist, and an attitude where bluntness is desirable over indirectness and often considered more polite. it has traditional art forms, history, word play, common life experiences. it has many things in common with black american culture, and many things in common with gay culture. i never met your neighbors, so i have no idea what their opinions of you were, but i doubt your questions came off as rude, just ignorant.",1,,2

534194,"girls use makeup to feel better about themselves and more confident. often because of insecurity, usually just to boost themselves. some girls paint on an entire face, redrawing cheekbones and jaw structure, drawing on eyebrows, turning their eyes into a different shape. i'll be honest, i only wear eye makeup myself and i'm happy with my face, so yes, it's probably hard for me to sympathize. but i'm not a 10 by any means, i just don't care. if someone isn't attracted to me that doesn't affect me. but when i meet someone for the first time, their demeanor and personality are the things that stick. i don't think twice about someone with one eye, or an ugly girl with no makeup, or someone who is really short. but if someone has caked on makeup, that will strike me because it is a choice that reveals a facet of personality, unlike the other things i mention.  now, i've said it before, but i live in canada. one thing i've learned is that in the us, people will bully based on disabilities. i cannot put into words how much that doesn't fly up here. bullying happens, but if you go after a kid for race or disability, the other kids will turn on you, nevermind the teachers. it's unthinkable for a kid with hearing aids to get made fun of. that translates to adulthood. we do not stand for making fun of someone for their health problems. we take those things seriously.  that translates into the workplace, too. i have had my employers be extremely good at accommodating me. my last workplace had two people blind in one eye and one with a severe lazy eye, one lady almost legally deaf with a hearing aid who yells when she talks and other people with hearing aids, a paraplegic, a woman who can hardly walk and has to have her other hip replaced after already getting one done, two of us have canes, and we had a guy with down syndrome and a girl with a personality disorder who worked as extra cleaners. this is not uncommon. our culture makes a point of being inclusive, and the companies benefit because it makes them look inclusive as well.  so again, your country is just shit at taking care of its people.  those stories made the news because they are appalling. they would be appalling if they happened to an able-bodied person, but they are made all the more terrible because they preyed on people less able to defend themselves. that is why disability is a protected class. you don't choose your disability, and we have society and government to ensure no one gets left behind based on circumstances outside of your control. again, your country is the worst developed nation in the world for this. look at betty devos getting confirmed despite openly advocating for fucking over disabled kids. how terribly insane when the rest of the first world is continually building resources to make sure these kids aren't left behind.  that gofundme link is interesting. sounds like he made a personal mistake and is responsible for his current circumstances. he is likely in ontario so likely getting disability (i feel like he would have mentioned it if he wasn't to add to his sob story), which means his income is the same as mine, so he can go fuck himself. maybe i should make a gofundme. disability isn't much, but we have taxes and programs so that people don't need to rely on charity. he's being quite bold by saying he is worth more than other people with disabilities, even though it was his choice to take a risk and liquidate everything to go chase a woman.  i was hoping he would read your posts and get inspired, maybe contact you to chat, but probably not. after speaking to him it's clear he is completely obsessed with his face and chasing those high number ratings. his personality is extremely offputting and despite his post he just wanted people to confirm his worldview and wouldn't listen to a fucking word anyone said. whining and complaining, no personal responsibility, no matter what happens well it's the fault of hisbugly face. that blame is is crutch and a focal point for him to ignore glaring issues. he was just an average looking guy.  if i remember correctly, you're not exactly a virgin and you were even married once. unless you were paying by the hour, those people were attracted to you in some way. if people who weigh 400 pounds and have to lift their gut to get to their dick can get laid, you sure as shit have a chance.",1,,0

669194,"first of all; it is ""straw man argument"" not ""technique"". ‚Äústraw manning‚Äù is defined as inventing your opponent‚Äôs position and assertions and the arguing against those. i don't see how the pygmy argument applies. your assertion is that under survival situations like that of the game‚Äôs, dwarves would not last. when i provide an example of people who by legal us law definitions would be considered dwarfs, thriving in some of the world‚Äôs harshest conditions, you dismiss it.  definition of midget: dwarfism, in medicine, is the condition of being undersized, or less than 127 cm (50 inches) in height. the term midget is usually applied to physically well-proportioned dwarfs. the term pygmy is applied to people whose shortness of stature is a racial trait. for the purpose of power, midgets will be attempted to be used, but the midgets will eventually be turned into a pygmy-like race.   in the 19th century, midget was a medical term referring to an extremely short but normally-proportioned person and was used in contrast to dwarf, which denoted disproportionate shortness. like many other older medical terms, as it became part of popular language, it was usually used in a pejorative sense. when applied to a person who is very short, midget is now often considered offensive. modern terminology designates the two descriptions now by proportionate dwarfism vs. disproportionate dwarfism [such as achondroplasia]. proportionate dwarfism is often the result of a hormonal deficiency [such as human growth hormone], and it may be treated medically.   the word dwarf has generally replaced midget even for proportionally short people, though the term little person is preferred. according to the little people of america, dwarfism is ""a medical or genetic condition that usually results in an adult height of 4'10"" [147 cm] or shorter, among both men and women, although in some cases a person with a dwarfing condition may be slightly taller than that.   if we are getting mixed up, it maybe because i don‚Äôt know exactly what you are asserting. are you defining survival entirely on sprinting ability? even then the pygmies display athleticism and running ability above many average first world citizens. i still think i'm being generous, not relying on the fallout lore of dwarves being physically robust, healthy and strong while short [5'].  if height and sprinting ability is your penultimate condition for survival then i can't help you. it's simply myopic.  some error correction: did i say autistic? oops! that‚Äôs one big typo. i meant ‚Äúaltruism‚Äù.  altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others. altruism in animals describes a range of behaviors performed by animals that may be to their own disadvantage but which benefit others.  other definitions place emphasis on the genetic consequences of altruism, e.g. altruism is ""instinctive behavior that is detrimental to the individual but favors the survival or spread of that individual's genes, as by benefiting its relatives."" or the biological fitness of the animals, e.g. ""altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor. altruism appears most obviously in kin relationships but may also be evident among wider social groups.  a good example of this is meerkats that will bark to attract a predator, even getting killed, so that young meerkats can escape, even remotely related ones like cousins.  humans are pack/social animals. like with other social animals, our survival and reproduction isn't about the strongest, fittest individual, but the strongest, fittest groups that use their unique human talents; planning and cooperation. our evolution favors altruism [helping each other]. kindness and helping is part of our survival instinct, much like the way wolves help each other. morality is based on societies' codes of conduct. it is subjective. there is no absolute moral law. morality differs from culture to culture. many cultures do agree on some moral issues [don't steal. don't kill.] because human altruism is an evolutionary product. our species benefits from cooperation and our survival is tied to our ability to work together. even other social animals have a rudimentary morality and cooperative instinct. morals and laws are based on human altruism, cooperation and the goal to optimize survival and health. within a society where the goal is to optimize survival and heath, there could be actions that are in such opposition to that end that they could be considered objectively wrong; murder, rape...  ...killing a woman's child because you deem it frail. such actions harm group cohesion.   human altruism might be based on self-interest ultimately. ""you help me with my crops, i'll help you with yours."" but with all the factors, it's a little more complicated than just gene protection.   ""would you die for a cousin?""   ""no, but i'd die for 2 sons or 4 nephews or 8 cousins or 16 cousin's sons or 32 cousin's grandsons or 64 unrelated people or 128 foreigners or 256 chimpanzees.""  the joke is that based purely on gene protection, you would select for the survival of the genes closest to you. human behavioral evolution does influence us to protect individuals with our genes as well as others that aren't related to us, due to increased survival chances. but morality isn't purely based on the one factor but many. you seem to entirely want to dispense with the disabled and not attempt to compartmentalize labor or find a niche for them, in lue of killing disabled infants at birth.  is this correct?  if we are entertaining hypothetical stories to illustrate a point let me advance some. i'd say a strong leader would be able to enforce his rule, making a mentally ill person fall in line to serve a function. by finding a niche for him to fit in, by finding a job he can do well, not harming anyone, a more amicable solution is found. killing the handicapped is an easy short term solution that in the long run harms group cohesion and genetic diversity.   cohesion: big tom isn't bright. he might have down syndrome or some other neurological birth defect. it's not like anyone could diagnose him.  despite his size and strength he is clumsy. he can't follow orders and has no attention span. you abandon him because he is a drain on resources and provides little to no labor in your group. after hearing how you abandoned big tom, his friends and family are outraged that you left a man with the mind of a 3 year old to die. big tom's mother is never going to forgive you for abandoning her son. even if he wasn't the smartest in the group, she begged you to give him a simple job that he could do in exchange for his share of the food. now that you are directly responsible for big tom's death his mother is quietly planning a revolt.  genetic diversity: after 2 generations of killing infants you deem frail and abandoning people you don't want to support, your group is essentially a large extended family with little genetic diversity. inbreeding is common and when a flu virus that your genetic make-up is susceptible to hits, everyone gets sick, leaving no one to care for the others. all of you weakened, your entire group falls prey to raiders.  eugenics is just not a good idea from a genetic perspective:  in 1915 by thomas hunt morgan, who demonstrated the event of genetic mutation occurring outside of inheritance. just because you think a genetic trait is undesirable, that does not mean it is inherited and not caused by environmental pressures. you might kill a infant because it is blind, not wanting it's blindness to spread to the next generation. but you don't know that the blindness is not inherited but a physical birth defect caused in the mother's uterus.  morgan claimed that this demonstrated that major genetic changes occurred outside of inheritance and that the concept of eugenics based upon genetic inheritance was, to some extent, not completely scientifically accurate. additionally, morgan criticized the view that subjective traits, such as intelligence and criminality, were caused by heredity because he believed definitions of these traits varied and accurate work in genetics could only be done when the traits being studied were accurately defined.  what you think is a weakness might be a strength in disguise. there simply is no agreed objective means of determining which traits might be ultimately desirable or undesirable. some diseases such as sickle-cell disease and cystic fibrosis respectively confer immunity to malaria and resistance to cholera when a single copy of the recessive allele is contained within the genotype of the individual. reducing the instance of sickle-cell disease in africa where malaria is a common and deadly disease could indeed have extremely negative net consequences.  like i illustrated genetic diversity is important. a culturally accepted ""improvement"" of the gene pool could very likely, as evidenced in numerous instances in isolated island populations [the dodo] result in extinction due to increased vulnerability to disease, reduced ability to adapt to environmental change and other factors both known and unknown. a eugenics plan might lead to a scenario similar to this because the elimination of traits deemed undesirable would reduce genetic diversity by definition.  and finally, it's simply unethical:  ""yes, have a way of judging their health and get rid of the extreme cases. no, don't throw them over a cliff. handle it humanely with as little pain as possible to them, however that may be.""  the problem is by what standard do you judge what is fit and unfit? what is extreme? a child born with no brain will simply die. but you used a child in a wheelchair as an example of unfit. that's not all that extreme. children in wheelchairs can learn to;  sew/ repair clothing  repair weapons  barter  account for resources  hack terminals  negotiate  preform arts: there are numerous characters in falloutnv whose occupation is singing or telling jokes. what level of developed community are you talking about? or do you dismiss anything above tribal like vegas/ncr/the followers/bos as not fitting the scope of your assertion. that is called ""begging the question"".  your hypothetical example decries that physical risk and danger is not shared equally? so now we are speaking about what is fair? i thought you were a utilitarian pragmatist. if some serve a purpose/job that is riskier than others and they have a gripe about it, demonstrate that no not all people are equally capable for all jobs.  it's not entirely fair to kill a person because you haven't yet found a utility for them.",1,,2

559529,"&gt; define 'learning disabilities' ‚Äî are we talking about adhd and dyslexia or forms of retardation? most learning disabilities are only apparent in specific situations and can be controlled by medication.  well quite, learning disabilities falls under a broad spectrum of serverity and acuity, as do all other disabilities. mild learning disabilities such as adhd shouldn't exclude people from most jobs. for more moderate learning disabilities, as in overall lower cognitive function, they can still perform tasks and be employed with reasonable adjustments. if you are deemed to have the skills and aptitude there is no reason there disability should be allowed hold them back.  &gt; by the same standards as any other candidate you say? candidates for jobs that are well qualified on paper are rejected all the time because 'they aren't a good fit' so i don't see denying a disabled person a job on that basis to be any different. of course you're not going to get an email saying 'well you're a crippled retard and we hate crippled retards' the rejection is going to be 'you're not a good fit for the company'.  yes by the same standards, as in offered the same opportunities to present themselves for the role. a company shouldn't be able to choose to advertise roles only to the able-bodied, to muslims only, to women only etc.    &gt; if their disability makes them harder to work with, or makes them require special accommodations then even though they may be equal on paper when it comes to things like an honours degree, a levels and experience they aren't equal in other places ‚Äî that's because no two people are equal.  that's the point, the employer doesn't know if it makes them harder to work with outside of reasonable adjustments, they just have their pre-conceptions and stigmas, which is not based on the candidate individually. they are not able to make that call based on the information. that is the whole point of the equality act.  &gt; what if someone has normal cognitive functions, but their physical impairment is such that they will need special accommodations at the office or will take a longer time to do their work or will have a hard time properly communicating with their coworkers?  the key term is reasonable adjustments. can you adapt a building site so someone with lower body paralysis can get up scaffolds? no, but can you make an office wheelchair accessible, or print things in larger font for the partially sighted, or communicate in writing for someone who is deaf? of course you can.  &gt; employers shouldn't have the right to make the choice on who they think is the best fit for the job? why even have interviews then we can just look at cvs? people discriminate constantly, they see a person with a disability and they know that person will have a harder time than someone with the same qualifications and no disabilities so why would they logically go through the trouble?  no they shouldn't have the right to select candidates based on their prejudices of that person's disability. as we often see in relation to protected characteristics people are misinformed, so saying they know the person will have a harder time is incorrect, they don't know anymore than the person applying does. a office manager shouldn't be able to apply that one article he read about ms in the telegraph to the eligibility of an individual candidate.   &gt; well yes, protected classes are really a pointless concept because there is still de facto discrimination and there will always be because people make choices and judgements about other people based on both objective (2:1 hons from lse, internship at a prestigious company) and subjective (half black wheelchair bound religious jewish cross dresser with a polish accent) factors.  i don't think pointless at all. you can't stop people making judgements, but you mitigate the impact of unfair subjective factors as much as possible, and also actively support hiring disabled staff through grants for making reasonable adjustments.  &gt; well nobody will know unless you tell them before they see you, but it's naive to think that your disability won't be taken into account in the hiring process and how you're perceived and it's asking people to reject their nature as humans (aka asking too much) to expect them to make judgements about employment without taking who you are outside of your qualifications into consideration.  yes you are asking people to reject their human nature, but that is exactly what a civilised society is! and disability will be considered yes, but there is a difference between excluding someone because of their disability, and identifying they have a disability but looking at their suitability as a candidate in spite of that.  &gt; well i mean they have to be prepared and accept that they do have a disability which is a negative thing that counts against them and with that they should realise that it will be harder for them in certain aspects of life because there are plenty of people with average qualifications who don't have a disability and thus have less baggage so they're going to have to go above and beyond average to balance out the disability and have the same opportunities as the average non-disabled person.  i don't think you mean it this way, but why would they be expected to go above and beyond the average person? if reasonable adjustments can be made for their role, the expectations of employment should be exactly the same.  i have to ask, in a society where we do not support and encourage people with disabilities into the job market or education, quite what role do you envisage for them in that society? shouldn't their independence be supported, not just for the state or families to look after them, but also to give them the same opportunities to a full life as anyone else?",1,,0

184034,"**i didn‚Äôt want to be unprepared for season 2, so i hosted my first rewatch**  rather than talk about the series as a whole, for our final discussion i‚Äôd like to talk about what bofuri and this rewatch in particular have meant to me.  bofuri is one of my favorite shows. it‚Äôs not one of those things where i can pin down a solid rank like #1 or #5 or so on, and it hasn‚Äôt changed my life in any dramatic or meaningful way as other shows have. however, it‚Äôs one of the handful i keep coming back to the most and never tire of. if i‚Äôm ever having a rough time, it‚Äôs one of the few things i know i can turn at any to that will pick me up a bit. or i can go to it when i‚Äôm feeling great and will be assured i‚Äôll leave feeling even better. bofuri is the first seasonal show i truly connected with once i began watching seasonally at the end of 2019. and now, having had the chance to share that feeling with many people has made it all the more meaningful to me.  now, i have to thank the many people who have made this such a worthwhile experience for me. since joining r/anime in 2020, i had never felt the desire to host a rewatch until season 2‚Äôs airdate was officially announced, partially because i was unsure i‚Äôd be able to be a sufficiently engaging host and partially because i had no idea whether anyone would be interested. so first of all, thank you to all the cdfers who contributed ideas for this rewatch and to u/nebresto and u/mysterybiscuitsoyeah specifically for encouraging me to take this on. thank you as well to everyone who regularly participated in the daily discussion threads, especially first-timers. your reactions were a daily delight. i couldn‚Äôt have imagined i would get such a large initial response, much less so many people contributing every day. thank you everyone who stopped by to participate once or twice and also everyone who stopped by just to see what everyone in the thread was saying. i hope we‚Äôve made these threads engaging and fun for all of you. lastly, thank you to source readers for expanding my knowledge beyond what the anime shows. it‚Äôs been a fun ride learning about how intricate a lot of the game is that the anime doesn‚Äôt have time to show.  thank you all for making time in your days the last 2 weeks to watch and discuss one of my favorite shows with me. you‚Äôve helped make my first rewatch such a big success and so so much fun. i appreciate each and every one of you and hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this experience as much as i have. and i hope you‚Äôll consider joining me again when i eventually host another one of these. one day. once i‚Äôm done rewatching bofuri for like the 12th time.  qotd:  1. maple &gt; sally &gt; mii &gt; bonk twins &gt; kasumi = iz = chrome = kanade &gt; most of the members of the other guilds &gt; dread  2. as a whole fight, maple vs. the flame emperors takes the cake. however, my favorite action is the part of frederica‚Äôs ambush where maple rescues sally.  3. i would welcome a proper sally vs. kasumi fight with open arms. i‚Äôd also like to see sally and frederica match wits one more time. it would also be nice to have shin become more of a character so kasumi can have a decent rival outside maple tree.  4. a multi-guild raid boss. i want to know what it‚Äôs like when the devs aren‚Äôt just trolling but set up an all-out raid- tier enemy instead of floor bosses that can be solo‚Äôd.  5. nwo reminds me a lot of the fictional mmo ‚Äúthe world‚Äù from the .hack//g.u. series, particularly in the way that main characters are able to freely break the game, albeit in much more outwardly horrifying ways.  6. no, though i don‚Äôt have any rational reason for saying so. on an emotional and functional level everything in the show seems way too ‚Äúreal life‚Äù for me to call bofuri an isekai, even though it probably technically fits any isekai definition or genre description.  7. yes! though i sadly won‚Äôt be able to make it to the threads as they drop because season 2 will be airing during the middle of my class day every week. woof.",0,,
682987,"hello there, i'm disabled myself. i was born with a severe visual disability that became worse over the years. i'm now completely blind on my left eye and on my right eye i see some vague shapes and colors. i don't have much functional sight left, though.  first of all, i encourage you to ask this question in r/blind. you wouldn't be the first person to do that ;). and i think people there could give you some helpful advice.  generally speaking, i advise you to treat your crush as ""normally"" as possible. obviously her disability can't be fully ignored and there are situations where it's important to be understanding and find work-arounds but overall, you should think of her as the person she is, not the disability. her blindness and the problems with her legs are simply one of many, many features this girl has. like being into a certain style of music or books. don't think of her disability as something that defines her.  furthermore, i encourage you to ask her whenever you are unsure about how to handle a certain situation. most able-bodied people are shy to ask questions because they are worried it might come across as offensive or hurtful. the truth is, though, most disabled people really appreciate being asked questions. for example when my wife and i first began to date, she asked me lots of things about my eyes, my vision and how she should act or assist me in certain situations. i absolutely loved this because it gave me the opportunity to explain things. sometimes when you're disabled, there are things you forget to explain because they seem so obvious to you. like many visually impaired or blind people, i have a slightly odd gait. i never thought much about this because it had always been like this. when my wife asked me about it, i got the chance to explain it. this was much nicer than if she had been wondering about it in her head. most blind people would rather be asked directly than people coming up with all kinds of guesses and assumptions because they're too polite to ask.  as for awkward actions or situations... it may feel a bit unfamiliar in the beginning because you've never been with a disabled person but honestly, it will only be awkward if you make it awkward. blind girls don't kiss any different from sighted girls... plus, us blind people are very good with our hands ;).  to answer your main question though: no, i actually have never dated a disabled person although i'm disabled myself. when i was 6 years old and finishing kindergarten, my parents and special education therapist asked me if i'd like to attend public school or a school for the blind. i told them without hesitation public school. while i have never regretted this decision, it has created a strange situation in which i basically grew up as a sighted kid. contrary to other blind folks, i don't know anyone who is visually impaired or blind. all of my friends are sighted. even though i'm blind, i sometimes feel as though i was sighted because i have grown up in a completely sighted environment. maybe a bit how a black person might feel white if they grow up in a super white environment. anyway, this circumstance made it so that i didn't really get to meet any disabled girls.  however, in high school i met a disabled girl whom i *almooost* ended up dating. she wasn't from my school though; i had been given her email address by my former special education therapist who had also worked with that girl. the girl was also visually impaired but her eyesight was better than mine. in addition to this, she also had a hearing impairment though (which i don't have). we went on some casual dates and began to like each other quite a bit. eventually, i asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend. at the time, i was planning to go on a student exchange year abroad. she knew this and told me she would've liked to be my girlfriend but she didn't want to make a commitment only for me to ""disappear"" in a couple of months. she also didn't want to wait an entire year for me to return home. i was of course said about her rejection but i could also understand where she was coming from.  2-3 years later i tried to reach out to her again but she had changed dramatically during that time. she was now dating some super weird guy with racist and right-extremist opinions. she now also had tattoos and dyed her hair etc... it was all pretty shocking. i actually remember visiting her at home and her parents both remembered me and were super sweet and nice to me but my former crush was acting all weird. when the girl went to the bathroom, her mom told me: ""i wish you could have been her boyfriend, it would've been so much better for her."" i think her parents kinda expected me to pull their daughter out of the swamp she was in but i realized this would cost me too much emotional energy, so i broke up contact.",1,,1

487629,"totally fair. here‚Äôs the text post    prepare for long message...  who i am...  there are a lot of disabilities and people with different conditions tend to think differently about themselves and the world so i want to lead of with who i am so you know where i‚Äôm coming from.  i have cerebral palsy which manifests for me in a lack of flexibility/motion control in my lower body, but not a total inability to walk. also, i get spasms and chronic pain. i use a wheelchair most of the time  ideological realism:  huge asterisk next to this entire section because obviously disabled people differ in opinion. however, in my personal observations there are some common traits and annoyances that might realistically show up in one or more of your characters.  stubbornness  as a result of being commonly underestimated some disabled people take self reliance to a extreme degree. for example, one of my friends wheeled herself a few miles in the snow on a popped tire rather than getting pushed. main characters in novels are often cartoonishly stubborn so as to keep the plot moving. this common personality trait of disabled people could be a useful way to address that.   words vs. meaning nearly every disabled person i know he‚Äôs more concerned with actual respect then with the words used to address this. we have a grand old time laughing about phrases like ‚Äúdifferently abled‚Äù which are really only there to make able people feel more comfortable.  exceptions to this include mentally disabled individuals who almost universally dislike the r word, and deaf people, who don‚Äôt appreciate being called disabled.  humor most of my friends  with conditions make jokes about it constantly. bonus points if the joke centers around something fucked up in the way the world treats the disabled. if three of your characters are going to be disabled they should absolutely talk hurmously about the myriad ways in which the world messes with them.   positive representation  it‚Äôs the little things i love seeing the little things done right. the son from breaking bad has cp and in the opening episode he struggles with pant legs and buttons!

 also, if we go to a disabled person‚Äôs house/drive their car it would be optionally cool for something in there to be diy modified to make their life easier   honest portrayal of movement go on youtube and find videos of people with the conditions you want to display doing every day things. there is a particular way (with a little room for variation) in which paralyzed people transfer from the wheelchair to another seat and a particular way wheelchair users bring themselves and their chair up stairs. it will take me out of the story of your character does something like that ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù   in world realism think through the implications of disability in your world. being a wheelchair user in america is different then being one in a less developed nation or a fantasy post apocalyptic setting  responses to disability first off, close friends interact w/ me much differently than strangers (usually close friends are refreshingly blunt, while strangers default to a well meaning politeness).   secondly, don‚Äôt be afraid of ‚Äúdark‚Äù discussions  i‚Äôm probably on the more physically able side of the disability spectrum and yet my love ones still put a lot of energy into helping me. i can tell i exhaust my brother sometimes and we‚Äôve had pretty serious discussions as a family about how my needs as a young child might have deprived my siblings of parental energy they could have benefited from.  it‚Äôs definitely ok to put a dynamic like that into the story. disability positivity doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre not allowed to wonder what might have been w/o the disability.   pet peeves: honestly, representation is so scarce it‚Äôs hard for me to think of things that i really dislike that show up prominently in media, but here it goes  don‚Äôt make a ‚Äúsupercrip‚Äù  think of all those posters that feature a runner with a prosthetic limb or some guy with no legs climbing a rock wall with brute are strength. they will invariably be captioned something like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your excuse!‚Äù don‚Äôt give that poster‚Äôs energy to your narrative. it is fine (cool actually) if your disabled character has an exceptional physical talent, but there should also be things they are straight up incapable of due to their condition and the other characters should treat them as valuable regardless. i know that seems obvious, but sometimes it seems like able people only want to see us in media when we don‚Äôt actually show any meaningful signs of impairment.  don‚Äôt make disability the character‚Äôs only emotional baggage it‚Äôs fine if your character struggles with their limitations of times. it‚Äôs also fine if the personal downsides of the condition don‚Äôt factor into the story that much, it‚Äôs your decision. definitely give them something unrelated to the disability to deal with and develop around though.  explicit powers some other people i know with disabilities don‚Äôt like the characters have abilities or superpowers related to their impairment (autistic character has rain man math ability and counts cards for example). i think the reason for this distaste is that this trope implies some sort of cosmic equilibrium wherein challenges always come paired with advantages. i‚Äôm sure you know from your mental health experiences that this is not always the case. i don‚Äôt mind this one so much because i love me some superpowers and i would love to be able to go to comic con as someone other than professor x.  thanks for bringing disabled people to life in fiction! hope this helps, sorry it‚Äôs kinda stream of consciousness. feel free to reach out with questions when you want to get particular details right.",1,,2

(typically commission would net you ¬£500+ for the week if you hit it)  just to be clear, that is not even close to analogous to the situation here.   in your case, you are paid a minimum plus paid extra if you meet performance targets. that is a perfectly normal pay arrangement.  what doordash does is completely different. it doesn't matter how good your performance is. in fact it is the opposite: *the company* is rewarded when you do better. the amount they have to spend to pay their drivers goes down as the tip goes up. from my perspective, this policy is flat-out fraudulent.",0,,

628570,"as a 20-something with a mild and life long disability (spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, from birth) i deal with a lot of things that most people wouldn't and don't think of. i'm off balance so walking in crowds even with my cane is very stressful and people just don't watch where they're going. whenever i walk on stairs in public it never fails that i get a cutesy or inspiring comment from a well meaning stranger, like ""woah there speed racer,"" ""good job!"" or, *to my parents* ""wow, she's doing better than me on those stairs!"" i know people are generally well meaning so i just smile and get on with my life, but it says a lot about how people think toward me and people like me. it just reminds me that i'm different or that on some level people think less of me than they do someone ""normal"".   it's hard enough to get jobs these days, but every time i *actually* get interviewed for a job and they see me, and then i don't hear back, i have to wonder if it's because of the palsy.  luckily i'm trying my hand at higher education (even though i will be in debt forever) in a field that serves people with disabilities, so having one myself may come at an advantage that my able peers do not have, but honestly, what in the world is someone like me supposed to do if they can't afford college? it's not like someone leg disabled can wait tables, or stand for 8-12 hrs at a time flipping burgers or cashiering (it's a miracle i last my pt 6hr shifts at the school cafeteria during the semester, even with taking breaks), and try getting a cushy desk job as a 20 something disabled person with no higher ed. or work experience.  as it is i have to cross my fingers to even get into grad school, and if i don't i'll be pretty much screwed, as my current job is the only one out of dozens i've applied for to give me a chance and they don't hire many full time workers even if i could handle that.   another thing that is difficult and royally screwed up is the hoops that you must jump through and extra cost you must deal with to get around  if you can't drive a normal car with foot pedals. they want you to undergo a ~$200 evaluation for what kind of adaptation you would need and then ~$200/hr  lessons  with a special car until they think you're ready to pass a drivers test. and then they prescribe you whatever hand gears or modified breaks or steering you would need and you have to go out and buy it, and have it installed in a car.  none of this is covered under medical insurance because driving is not a medical necessity. i neither have a car which i could fix up, nor the money for any of this stuff so i take para transit/shared ride to university/work 5 days a week. shared ride is a mini bus service that picks me up at my house and drops me off in front of whatever building i need to be at. sounds good right? not really. they charge $4.50 each way for a 20-25 minute ride. that is most of my paycheck. also, they have too many clients and are terrible at making the routes to begin with, so i've been picked up at 5:45am for an 8am class, and had to wait around in the dark for janitors to open up the buildings. also, i finish work/classes at either 3 or 4:30, and usually don't get home in time for dinner. i sit out on the curb waiting for hours, and then sit on the bus while they pick up and drop off others for hours. the latest i've been dropped home was a quarter to 8, and they say they stop running at 5:30. ha! i have to also keep calling and checking with them because there have been times where they screwed up and forgot me, and i get stranded for hours until one of my parents can get to me. it's hard to function in school or have a social life when i have to get up so early and have to squeeze everything i need to do on campus between 8 and 5:30, but i have no choice.   i tried once to see if i am eligible for ssi, because they could help me get out on my own and with that low of an income i'd get help paying for all of these things and probably school as well, but they say that because i am not in unmanageable pain or on wheels, i'm not *really* disabled. i'm too disabled for employers to not be scared to hire me to do the few jobs i might be able to handle, but not disabled *enough* for any help getting on my feet and taking care of myself seeing as i am limited. i'm in handicapable limbo here.  it's not just legally, but socially. to other disabled people its almost like i don't count because i can walk and do my own personal care, but i don't feel like i fit in with able-bodied people either. there are just things that they do and enjoy that i'll never relate to (running, biking, dancing, playing sports) i try to do normal college girl things like go out to clubs, sometimes i end up getting tipsy enough that i'm okay with wobbling around like an asshat to music and getting stared at because without the cane i just look really drunk. most of the time i'm just standing there watching the other girls in envy. they are all wearing cute shoes that i can't even stand up in, dancing with guys that won't even look at me even though i'm prettier than them, and they make moving to the music look so easy and fun. there's something graceful about the way they move, even if they're being total sluts about it, because for them it's fluid and effortless. i feel like a cross between the tin man and a wet noodle. stiff, yet not controlled. so dancing, no.   it's also hard to feel sexy when i'm stuck in a body that isn't, and when i have to deal with being patronized, or felt sorry for. it's hard to feel attractive when you know the reason people stare is not because of your stunning beauty. or when the only people who ever asked you out were special ed students in high school when you used to help out in their class during free period. it was really sweet to get handmade valentines written in crayon though :3   it just boggles my mind that you guys can just walk. you don't have to consciously try. your body just knows the right way to move. every step i have to try extra hard not to drag my toes, to remind myself to stand up straighter, to worry that i'm stomping disturbing someone who isn't awake yet, or that i'm going to splash someone walking next to me outside when there are puddles.  and when i fall, everyone loses their minds! it's why i carry the cane so i can just pull myself back up again if i do somehow derp hard and land on my face. i fall a lot so to me it's no big deal, but people act like they just watched me break every bone in my body if i take a tumble off a curb. would you make a big deal of some girl who wore stillettos that were a bit too high and tripped? no you'd probably laugh at her, maybe help her up, and go on with your lives. you wouldn't freak out, try to pick her up without asking, keep asking over and over if she's okay even after she's obviously standing back up and nothing's bleeding, or try to call an ambulance. i've had all of those things happen. the label i fall under usually means more to people than what i actually present. people know i am disabled, and they have subtly been taught that disabled = frail, child-like, incapable, whether they realize it or not. i deal with the implications of that every day.  and then there is the other side of that same coin, that disabled people are ""inspirational"", even when they're just doing every day normal people things. if i studied neuroscience and figured out how to rewire my own brain so that i wouldn't have to deal with all of this nonsense, that would be pretty inspirational. don't say i'm inspirational for making  he dean's list or taking the stairs. normie pls.  edit: alien blue is being weird and it isn't letting me reply to op :( sorry",1,-1,-1
944722,"the nazi racial policies rely on darwin and the further darwinist elaborations of spencer and haeckel.   &gt;*‚Äòone of the central planks in nazi theory and doctrine was ‚Ä¶evolutionary theory [and] ‚Ä¶ that all biology had evolved ‚Ä¶ upward, and that ‚Ä¶ less evolved types ‚Ä¶ should be actively eradicated [and] ‚Ä¶ that natural selection could and should be actively aided, and therefore [the nazis] instituted political measures to eradicate ‚Ä¶ jews, and ‚Ä¶ blacks, whom they considered as ‚Äúunderdeveloped‚Äù*  &gt;darwin even compiled a long list of cases where he concluded bad blood polluted a whole gene line, causing it to bear impure progeny forever. numerous respected biologists, including ernst ruedin of the university of munich and many of his colleagues such as herbert spencer, francis galton, and eugene kahn, later a professor of psychiatry at yale, actively advocated this hereditary argument. these scientists were also the chief architects of the german compulsory sterilization laws designed to prevent those with defective or ‚Äòinferior‚Äô genes from contaminating the aryan gene pool. later, when the ‚Äògenetically inferior‚Äô were also judged as ‚Äòuseless dredges‚Äô, massive killings became justified. the groups judged inferior were gradually expanded to include a wide variety of races and national groups. later, it even included less healthy older people, epileptics, both severe and mild mental defectives, deaf-mutes, and even some persons with certain terminal illnesses.  &gt;much of the opposition to the eugenic movement came from german christians. although hitler was baptized a catholic, he was never excommunicated, and evidently ‚Äòconsidered himself a good roman catholic‚Äô as a young man, and at times used religious language. he clearly had strong, even vociferous, anti-christian feelings as an adult, as did probably most nazi party leaders. as a consummate politician, though, he openly tried to exploit the church.55 hitler once revealed his attitude toward christianity when he bluntly stated that religion is an:  &gt;‚Äò *‚Ä¶ organized lie [that] must be smashed. the state must remain the absolute master. when i was younger, i thought it was necessary to set about [destroying religion] ‚Ä¶ with dynamite. i‚Äôve since realized there‚Äôs room for a little subtlety ‚Ä¶. the final state must be ‚Ä¶ in st. peter‚Äôs chair, a senile officiant; facing him a few sinister old women ‚Ä¶ the young and healthy are on our side ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs impossible to eternally hold humanity in bondage and lies ‚Ä¶. [it] was only between the sixth and eighth centuries that christianity was imposed upon our peoples ‚Ä¶. our peoples had previously succeeded in living all right without this religion. i have six divisions of ss men absolutely indifferent in matters of religion. it doesn‚Äôt prevent them from going to their death with serenity in their souls.‚Äô*  &gt;as early as 1925, hitler outlined his conclusion in chapter 4 of mein kampf that darwinism was the only basis for a successful germany and which the title of his most famous work‚Äîin english my struggle‚Äîalluded to. as clark concluded, adolf hitler:  &gt;*‚Äò ‚Ä¶was captivated by evolutionary teaching‚Äîprobably since the time he was a boy. evolutionary ideas‚Äîquite undisguised‚Äîlie at the basis of all that is worst in mein kampf -and in his public speeches ‚Ä¶. hitler reasoned ‚Ä¶ that a higher race would always conquer a lower.‚Äô*  &gt;and hickman adds that it is no coincidence that hitler:  &gt;*‚Äò ‚Ä¶ was a firm believer and preacher of evolution. whatever the deeper, profound, complexities of his psychosis, it is certain that [the concept of struggle was important because] ‚Ä¶ his book, mein kampf, clearly set forth a number of evolutionary ideas, particularly those emphasizing struggle, survival of the fittest and the extermination of the weak to produce a better society.‚Äô *  http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v13/i2/nazi.asp   because many redditers are violently anti-religious they tend to ignore anything that's wrong in the evolutionists' works.   darwin himself was a racist by today's standards (e.g. he was referring to africans as savages,) - he was indeed against slavery and eugenics but nevertheless considered some human races as inferior (see below).   today's political correctness advocates have a similar view, they are actually patronizing some minorities and have the feeling that without help from the state (in e.g. college admission) those people (being inferior) won't do well.   **read and weep, evolutionists:**  &gt;*the chief distinction in the intellectual powers of the two sexes is shown by man attaining to a higher eminence in whatever he takes up, than woman can attain‚Äîwhether requiring deep thought, reason, or imagination, or merely the use of the senses and hands.""*  charles darwin  &gt;*at some future period, not very far distant, as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate the replace throughout the world the savage races.*  charles darwin  &gt;*the more civilized so-called caucasian races have beaten the turkish hollow in the struggle for existence. looking to the world at no very distant date, what an endless number of the lower races will have been eliminated by the higher civilised races throughout the world.*  charles darwin  he also placed the ""negro"" on the evolutionary scale between the baboon and the ""civilized races of man"".  funny thing is that actually it's the creationists who are race-blind unlike the evolutionist social darwinists.  **edit**: downmods without reply. **that's how they are**.  **edit 2** ok, ok, you convinced me. i'm an evolutionist myself now and i think some of the redditers are unevolved idiots somewhere in between the baboon and the creationists.  :)",x,,

443250,"&gt; normally i‚Äôm very down on overlapping instances: it seems really fragile to rely on details of the type-inference engine to select what code should run. but this is a particularly benign case: here the overlapping instances are over phantom type variables, so the same code will run in either case. maybe haskell should allow that in general; overlapping instances are fine if the same run-time code is produced however the instances are resolved.  phantom types don't guarantee nothing (wrt overlapping instances). it's not true that phantom type variables don't have any link to the ""code"" that'll be run:      data isnothing = isnothing     data isjust    = isjust          data tmaybe l a where         tnothing ::      tmaybe isnothing a         tjust    :: a -&gt; tmaybe isjust    a  in fact, phantom types are problematic solution - you have to trust, that the author (jose iborra in this case) correctly designed them, didn't introduce any bugs, remembered to close/make abstract some things that would allow to create arbitrarly typed phantom values and so on.  what about overlapping instances? this use (i mean control-monad-exception) is ok, because it's used to implement type-level functions, that overlap on argument's type (they do type-level equivalent of pattern-matching or if-statement) and in both cases they return values of different types, so even if something goes with type inference not as user planned, it will result in another type, probably even type error. there's nothing generating random surprises. so,  &gt; overlapping instances are fine if the same run-time code is produced however the instances are resolved.  , but sometimes there is no run-time.  sure, it can easily stop being that nice wtf-free if someone adds a new overlapping instance. but it's not unsound and if you do what you're not supposed to, don't be surprised that there are problems.",0,,

504392,"my elder brother had cerebral palsy, in a relatively mild form. i'm the younger sibling and had no understanding that the way he walked was not normal (pronounced limp). no-one ever discussed his disability with me and i did not know he had one, so i had zero understanding of multiple social interactions. for example, people (i now understand) expecting him to be retarded and then telling me how intelligent he was when he said anything. i just thought it meant i was the stupid one. he consistently put me down and ridiculed me, which would not have been socially acceptable had he not been disabled, but because i didn't understand that he was any different to me, i just assumed i was stupid. as an adult he is still incapable of having a conversation with me without ridiculing me, so i have decided never to speak to him again. i quite profoundly hate him and rather than living full of hate i'd rather not have him in my life. my parents seemed to translate ""physical disability"" into ""emotional disability"" and saw me as another adult. when my father was dying of cancer, he considered i should be the one with him when he died because my brother was ""not capable"" of dealing with it. (i was there, it was fine, but the idea that i might also find watching someone die traumatic was seen as lesser than the potentiel trauma to my disabled brother). my assumption that i should be emotionally responsable towards other people, whatever the cost to me, has exposed me to multiple situations of abuse in adult relationships, combined with my lack of ability to defend myself (due to my brother's bullying) and lack of ability to ask for help. everyone at school was invested in seeing him succeed due to his disability. i was the benchmark against which he was measured. if i achieved anything, he would punish me, as if i had revealed his disability. if i succeeded it would mean i was also disabled so i was a chronic underacheiver.  he purposefully made me feel bad about anything he thought i might excel him in. i never found my own hobbies that weren't ridiculed or in which he showed me to be inferior to him. my mother put everything he did down to ""normal sibling rivalry"" so as not to have to deal with her disabled child abusing the non-disabled one. she expects that i will be the one taking care of her in her old age and does not expect anything from him (despite the fact that he has a much more successful career than me and i am an assistant (cf. underacheiver and abusive relationships having an impact on careers). even talking about it as an adult, people expect me to have some medical understanding of his condition, but my understanding comes entirely from wikipedia as my family was too invested in giving him a ""normal"" childhood to want to recognise or explain to me that he was not normal. cutting him out of my life was one of the best decisions i ever made.",1,-2,-2
984073,"i read through this thread and i feel like...  ok, i have one leg. if tomorrow a surgery were to exist that could give me two, would i take it? no, probably not. the only motivations i'd have to take it would be if a group of doctors or scientists approached *me* specifically stating they felt i was a perfect trial subject and asked me to partake in the surgery to assist their research (sure, happy to help) or if the surgery proved financially superior to remaining disabled, as prosthetics are stupidly expensive.   the thing for me is that...who are we but our life experiences? your experiences mold who you are, and for me, i've never had two legs. if i got a second leg, it feels off to me. my disability has certainly molded my personality out in certain ways simply because of the way people react to that, so to throw away my disability is to throw away a piece of my history, i feel like. i also think the world is largely quid pro quo, so while you and other able-bodied individuals may highlight that yeah i can't ride a bike (i could, but i'd have to do it with one leg and taking the prosthetic off involves taking my pants off, so sounds impractical), i would likewise highlight that i feel my leg has helped mold my personality in positive ways. it's made me more sympathetic i feel, and it's helped hone my sense of humor as oklahoma forced me to learn to laugh off/outwit any insults i got for being disabled. and quite frankly, *sometimes* society pities you in ways that's beneficial. i've had government offices realize i had one leg and then they'd make extra effort to process my application for financial aid or whatever, even though my disability had jack all to do with that application. as such, yeah, it's ""lucky"" at times and i would be hesitant to view a disability as a strict hinderance. my one leg means i can't run or ride a bike. okay. and this is important in my day to day life *how* exactly? honestly i feel it helps as much as it hurts, and just as many good experience can arise from it as bad.  ***having said that,*** i just got done saying it's quid pro quo. that means i see benefits and downsides in *everything,* and that's precisely why i wouldn't be sooooo absorbed in keeping my disability if being able-bodied proved cheaper or i happened to be a helpful subject in regards to advancing that technology; i'm sure i would gain good experiences from being able-bodied as well.   as such, to me, reading through these comments about how odd the deaf community is, i find myself compelled to acknowledge that no, a disability isn't neccesarily a bad thing, ***however*** it's also weird to view it as a good thing. to me my one leg is akin to me having blue eyes. do i only associate with blue eyed people? no wtf why the fuck would i do that. do i view blue eyed people as inferior or superior? uhh no, again that's hella weird. would i be livid or flip the fuck out if i were to have a kid with any other eye color, or if some life event permanently changed the color of my eyes? of course not.  with a (physical, more on that below) disability, it's an important to find a balance between understanding it's true that it doesn't hold you back and you *are* just as capable as others with very limited exceptions, but you also need to avoid becoming soooooo god damned absorbed and defined by your disability that you spend a lifetime letting it define you as you desperately try to prove your equality (or even superiority, apparently). it's a thing. a thing with a very obvious hinderance attached to it, rather subtle benefits, and in the end the world is quid pro quo. do not dwell on it, do not be bothered by it, do not become obsessed with it.  i should also note that i would hesitate to claim mental disabilities are not an absolute net loss. the thing is that if you can function day-to-day in society without issues, then what's the problem? ""survival of the fittest"" is about who can adapt to the world, and can disabled people adapt? absolutely, i mean look at stephen hawking. dude can't wipe his own ass but you better fucking believe society is gonna wipe his ass for him if he needs it done, because he's a phenominal benefit to society. however, today's society stresses the importance of mental capacity, and as such that means that physical disabilities can easily function within society with little issue. (with quite a bit of variance between the varying types, of course. i mean some physical disabilities are downright painful to have, which would of course act as a constant hinderance, and stephen hawking is also a very noticeable outlier and exception for his specific limitations; most that have his exact limitations would absolutely have difficulty adapting in this world) for mental handicaps however, that is not really the case, more often than not. i just point that out to highlight that for me, i would not dwell on a disability *so long as* it proves an active hinderance in a vital component of day to day life. i would indeed laugh at someone who believes i'm not living a fulfilling life because i use a prosthetic, because that sounds absolutely ridiculous. if someone said the same about an individual suffering from severe autism...? well i mean we can't really say for certain how pleased with existence such a person is (for all we know they could be high on life), but obviously from our perspectives, yes, we have very very good reason to believe they're not enjoying a fulfilling life to the same degree as you or i, sadly. for the *deaf* community...? i personally find it rather odd that for some of them, they cannot easily communicate with as many people as they'd like to. any life experience where you've met a good friend by overhearing their conversation? that is lost if you're deaf. yes you gain some scenarios where you ""overhear"" a sign language conversation, but those obviously happen much less frequently. this world and the culture of our society today stresses intelligence and social skills as important things to have, and yes, deafness can absolutely hinder social skills (can, many deaf people do learn to speak and read lips with an impressive level of aptitude to counteract this), making life less fulfilling.   as such, i do gotta say it's exceedingly strange to hear the deaf community often develops it's own little cult thing....though i can't say i'm surprised, given my own experiences with deaf people. like the disabled community as a whole tends to have a mix of people who refuse help entirely and those that live off of exploiting pity, with many in between of course. the deaf people i've met...? they've honestly given me this impression that they wanted to say to me ""fuck yes i can get these stupid able-bodied people to do whatever i want cause they pity me. hell, i can be a prick to you too and no one would bat an eye at it because i outrank you in terms of disabledness."" i've met deaf people that just seemed absolutely concious-yet-shameless about the stuff they could get away with. if you come across a spoiled disabled guy, typically it's like ok he's an ass but he doesn't know any better; his parents raised him to be entitled so sadly he'll always be that way. some of the deaf people i've met seemed wise to how undeserved some of the special treatment they got is, and yet they seemed to sadistically take pleasure in exploiting that, and indeed, there was one in particular that absolutely 100% gave me the impression he was ""taunting"" me with what he could get away with. that's not all deaf people of course, but the ones i've met that *were* like that certainly left a lasting impression, i'll say that.    **tl;dr** there's many reasons to refrain from blindly viewing disabilities as a pure hinderance. some are, some aren't in the sense they have equal benefits attached to their downsides. i'd caution against acting as though someone wanting to keep their disability is outrageous because there probably are benefits they're accustomed to and wanna keep that you simply haven't experienced yourself; it's not always black and white. having said that, viewing a disability as *superior* is equally fucknuts insane, and yes different disabilities are different degrees of ""doesn't really matter"" and ""this is a severe hinderance to my enjoyment of life."" deafness absolutely cuts into one's potential social life, and as such, yeah i'd say it's a more limiting disability and yeah as such, it's absolutely odd to hear the deaf community sometimes has this militant cult thing going on.",1,,-1
845372,"disabled, nerodivergent  is fine!! i‚Äôm sure you rly meant no harm, but that term is pretty ableist. i copy pasted parts of one of a favorite article of mine below to help the understanding of that term. below is the link of the full article below.  [included a quote from this blog below](https://www.google.com/amp/s/humanparts.medium.com/amp/p/4ed8637036c3)  ‚Äúwhen a person uses phrases like ‚Äúspecial,‚Äù ‚Äúhandi-capable,‚Äù and ‚Äúdifferently abled,‚Äù it tells me they have a lot to learn about how disabled people function in society. these are people who tend to believe comforting platitudes like ‚Äúthe only disability is a bad attitude,‚Äù and tend to find it ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù when they see a video of a person with down syndrome going to prom. in real life, these same folks are usually squeamish about acknowledging that someone around them has a disability.  i‚Äôm here to tell you, you don‚Äôt have to take part in the elaborate, unsettling song and dance of denying a person‚Äôs disability or hiding it behind a euphemism. you can cut straight through the condescension. if a person has a disability, you can call them disabled. it‚Äôs not a bad word or a source of shame. in fact, acknowledging disability openly can help us fight against ableism and injustice.  it‚Äôs true that every person has a different ability level. however, some people truly are impaired, or lack certain abilities that abled people possess. when you imply that everyone is a bit different, you end up silencing the people who are different in ways that leave them marginalized or excluded.  often, being disabled means lacking a physical or mental function that abled people have, or functioning in a significantly altered way. a person who cannot walk does not have ‚Äúdifferent walking abilities‚Äù than a person who can walk. they can‚Äôt walk. that function is disabled. this doesn‚Äôt make them inferior‚Äîit just means that they benefit from having access to tools like wheelchairs.  i‚Äôm autistic, and while autism has brought many wonderful things into my life, it also is a developmental disability. i didn‚Äôt socially or emotionally develop at the same pace as an abled person. for years, i lacked the ability to understand my own emotions or recognize when i was hungry, tired, or stressed. it took me until my mid-twenties to develop social skills that most people have by their teens.  i‚Äôm not ‚Äúdifferently abled.‚Äù i‚Äôm disabled. and that‚Äôs okay to say. in fact, openly acknowledging a disability allows us to have frank conversations about a person‚Äôs needs and limits. physically disabled people often need access to tools like chairlifts, elevators, wheelchairs, canes, and pain medication.    mentally disabled people often need sensory-friendly spaces, relaxed social expectations, and for complex topics to be explained in clear, direct ways. when we avoid the word ‚Äúdisabled,‚Äù we make expressing these distinct needs much more difficult  a disability is much more than a set of clear-cut physical or mental symptoms. often, society excludes and ignores disabled people in a way that actively robs us of agency and ability. it‚Äôs not just our conditions that disable us. we are also ‚Äúdis-abled‚Äù by a society that is unaccommodating or outright hostile.  there‚Äôs no reason to tiptoe around the reality of someone being disabled unless you consider those things to be shameful.  if you are uncomfortable acknowledging that someone is blind, deaf, paralyzed, autistic, or has down syndrome, it‚Äôs probably because you think disability makes a person less worthy. there‚Äôs no reason to tiptoe around the reality of someone being disabled unless you consider those things to be shameful.  this is perhaps the biggest problem with the use of softening and obscuring terms like ‚Äúspecial,‚Äù ‚Äúhandi-capable,‚Äù ‚Äúdifferently abled,‚Äù or ‚Äúspecial needs.‚Äù they belie a person‚Äôs discomfort with acknowledging the reality of disability. unfortunately, their very use worsens the stigma against people with disabilities, because it furthers the idea that such conditions are unspeakable, or too shameful to name.  when disability is hidden away or obscured, so are disabled people‚Äôs attempts at attaining justice. if you want to be an ally to your disabled siblings, all you have to do is let go of your desire to clench up, and wince, and pretend that all people are equally ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù and all abilities are equally privileged in our society. disability exists. it is a beautiful source of diversity. it is not a thing to hide away.‚Äù   - devon price",1,,2

342494,"1: that's fairly normal. the foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. if it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. but in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. it might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so i wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. if it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, i don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. i hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  i know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, i really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. but here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/penis-health/pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. and it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. but, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. i wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. it isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.  but every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.  5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. your reaction is up to you.  most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. so doing it quick and only short glances is best. but curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  it isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  but eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. it's one of those things you get used to. when you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. nobody really does tbh.",0,,

567284,"i focus much more on context and the intended meaning behind words than i do on the words themselves.   you can say the exact same thing with different tone, or in a different context, and the real meaning and effect can be radically different.  i have no interest in insulting people with learning disabilities.   in general, i don't really want to insult anyone, even my ""enemies.""   i'm against bullying and intolerance.  that said, in my understanding, ""retarded"" is a word that is meant to signal a difference between a person with average/normal (in a statistical sense) mental functioning, and a person that is incapable of the kinds of thinking/learning/problem solving that a person with average/normal mental functioning is capable of.   it's kind of acknowledging a disability.   disability is always a relative thing.     my mom had a stroke last year, and while we haven't had her tested yet, i imagine she went from somewhat higher than average iq (she was really pretty sharp) to much, much below average iq.   her cognitive capabilities have declined tremendously, and realistically, she probably will never get most of that back.   she is extremely easily confused, struggles to understand basic concepts, directions, instructions, etc.   she struggles with speech, memory, coordination, balance, etc.   in a classic sense, she is, in effect, somewhat ""retarded.""   we can change the words used, but it amounts to the same thing.    she's ""mentally disabled"" or ""mentally handicapped.""    and this is what i mean about meaning and context.   the above, even if i didn't use the word ""retarded,"" would be hurtful to my mom.   if i said: ""mom, you probably dropped 30 points of iq... it's apparent that you are easily confused and can't understand a lot of basic things"" it would probably be hurtful to her.   and that's a good reason not to talk to her that way, even avoiding ""slurs.""     and, simultaneously, all of us are familiar with people routinely throwing around words like ""fool"" ""foolish"" ""stupid"" ""idiotic"" and so on.   what do you all think these terms mean?   who do they refer to?   what does it mean to be a fool, or to be stupid?   why isn't ""stupid"" a slur?   why isn't ""idiot"" a slur?   why is it ok to belittle someone's intelligence with those words, and not ""retard?""     i think the argument would go along the lines of ""a stupid person has a choice... they could do better if they tried!""   but that's an assumption.  a really big one, actually.   you are assuming that given the exact same circumstances, you would do things differently/better than someone else.   how do you know that?   you are also making some big assumptions about freewill/determinism.   again, how do you know?      the fact is, at least as far as my use of the word has gone, ""retard"" is used in exactly the same way as the word ""stupid"" or ""idiotic.""   i've zero interest in going around to people with learning disabilities and insulting them, just as i have zero interest in making my mom feel bad for her cognitive issues post-stroke.     my honest take is that people are too precious about words.   the issue isn't the word.   the issue is bullying.   bullying is fucked.   ""retarded"" is just a word.   we know what it means.     with some people, you really can never win.   anything you say can be nitpicked and anyone can find fault with anyone else.   like, you could get bullied for not being vegan.   you could get bullied for being vegan.   you could be picked on for being a wimpy dweeb, or you could be ridiculed for being a stupid jock.   you can be hated for being a socialist or a capitalist.     isn't even acknowledging ""disability"" a kind of ""ableism?""   like, keep in mind, a lot of deaf people don't even show interest in being able to hear.   are they disabled then?   who decides?   is it an insult to call someone ""blind?""   is it an insult to call someone ""crippled?""   what about in a different context, like ""emotionally crippled""?      i'm on board with pc as far as pc is about treating people with compassion and respect.   but the nitpickyness over words really loses me.   at the end of the day, just be nice to people.     that's my humble 2 cents anyway.   maybe i'm just a hopeless retard.",1,,-1
227681,"&gt; having trouble completing homework is completely different from being learning disabled.   ?  &gt;a blind person would have trouble writing on paper he can't see. is that person learning disabled?  yes, it certainly wouldn't help them with their education. i imagine ""visualizing"" things could be harder for them,  &gt;a person with schizophrenia can't hear the teacher over the five voices in thier head. is that person learning disabled?   definitely. the inability to listen to an instructor most certainly impacts their ability to learn.  &gt;a person who became catatonic and mute while depressed could be physically incapable of movement meaning they also couldn't get homework done.   and they would be considered very very disabled.  &gt;disorders that don't relate to learning directly,   and yet they **in**directly make it very hard to perform in the education system. that place where you learn things.  &gt;ocd is a mental illness like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. it is not a learning disability. a learning disability is something like dyslexia or adhd which exclusively makes learning harder.  does it make completing schoolwork harder? impact your grades?   then it's a learning disability and your grades shouldn't really be compared to other's. that would be unfair.   hey, you're smart. that's great. really puts a twist on the disability thing. reminiscent of that rain man savant shtick. but because you're got extra shit to deal with, you get placed in a group of people that aren't expected to perform like other people.   maybe you're getting hung up on the idea that ""disability"" means it is impossible for you to do something.   naw man, someone can have lame legs and kinda sorta walk, but still be disabled. he's less disabled then a full amputee, but they both get the special parking pass.   &gt;adhd which exclusively makes learning harder.  oh hoho!  that's not all it makes harder! if for some reason you thought people with this affliction could simply hang it up on a coat-rack after school got out, then you are sadly mistaken.  still feel bad for my nephew.  and my sister now that i think about it.",1,,1

documentary on stalin's little known ""para-penal battalion."" this little known story goes like this:  in 1941, in the name of the motherland, stalin ""mobilized"" (terrible pun intended) the 141st para-penal regiment. the 1941 mobilization was actually the second mobilization of this surprisingly mobile four-wheeled crusade against the rise of fascism. the first regiment was organized during the ""para-purges"" of the late 1930s, when he began purging the physical rehab facilities of paraplegic ""dissidents, capitalists and four-wheeled bourgeoisie."" the 1941 redux of the para-batallion consisted of 1940s-era ""bourgeoisie oscar pistorius types"" (the blade-running frogmen and rambo-like commandos of the soviet penal battalions) as well as other smaller regimental divisions, each of which had their unique title and banners, such as the:  ""two-wheeled trotskyists,""  ""disabled political dissidents,""  ""suck-n-blow wheeled wicked westernized weaklings,""  ""crippled/cereberal palsyed capitalists...or the 'crutched crusaders',""  ""deaf-blind-n-dumb-dissidents,""  ""blind black marketeers""  ""wheelchair ramp revisionists,""  ""disabled parking tag profiteers""  and the ""pro-western para-capitalist pig-dogs...on crutches,""  obviously, each battalion included a (terrible pun #2) ""motorized rifle regiment,"" of mosin-nagant armed wheelchair snipers and riflemen on modified half-track all-terrain wheelchairs powered by the same diesel engines that powered the t34 tanks.  and lets not forget that these battalions also included four-wheeled-rifle-women, of course, as stalin was a highly progressive fourth-wave feminist who believed in co-ed armies.  when the nazis observed the highly effective use of soviet para-penal battallions in highly mobile winterized warfare, they decided to halt their t4 euthanasia program of the feeble minded and disabled and began putting conscripting their asylum patients and disabled populations into a finely disciplined, winterized para-prussian battalion. i'm looking for someone to write up a good summary for the para-panzer ace, ""no-shoes"" waffen-ss schmidt, a member of the ""wheeled waffen-ss"" who fought with great courage in virtually every theater of german combat, including the surprisingly politically correct titled, ""less-than-able-bodied afrikacorps"" under their commander, erwin rommel's lesser known nephew, karl ""the crutched cameltoe of the kasserine"" rommel, known to allied commanders during the battle of kasserine pass as ""death on two crutches.""  i haven't even gotten into the biography of the genius ""irwin, the iron lung enigma"" (briefly held the title of the 3rd earl irwin) the paralyzed british code breaker, from whom alan turing stole the original design for the computers that eventually broke the german enigma code.  i also did a few sketches of hitler's secret weapon on the eastern front, the ss-midget brigade, consisting of ""himmler's ss-hobbits on hounds,"" the dwarves and midgets throughout the reich were conscripted to ride into battle on german shepards, trained to run underneath soviet main battle tanks and attach explosives or mines. and

565971,"&gt;i don't disagree with you largely there, if someone has a learning disability and is not able to do certain jobs they won't be applying for them and so inherently won't have the same opportunities as someone without a learning disability, fair enough. equally for severe autism spectrum disorders there are limitations in understanding that would preclude them from being able to do some jobs, but they are never likely to get the experience or education to be able to do that anyway, so i think it wouldn't really come up.   glad we agree there.   &gt;but there are jobs that people with learning disabilities can do,    define 'learning disabilities' ‚Äî are we talking about adhd and dyslexia or forms of retardation? most learning disabilities are only apparent in specific situations and can be controlled by medication.   &gt;and if they wish should be considered on the same standards as any other candidate.    by the same standards as any other candidate you say?   candidates for jobs that are well qualified on paper are rejected all the time because 'they aren't a good fit' so i don't see denying a disabled person a job on that basis to be any different. of course you're not going to get an email saying 'well you're a crippled retard and we hate crippled retards' the rejection is going to be 'you're not a good fit for the company'    &gt;being disabled in that regard shouldn't count against them, as they are equal to another candidate for the job spec.  if their disability makes them harder to work with, or makes them require special accommodations then even though they may be equal on paper when it comes to things like an honours degree, a levels and experience they aren't equal in other places ‚Äî that's because no two people are equal.    &gt;even more so for other disabilities where the candidate has normal cognitive function. if they have the employment and education history they need, there is no reason someone should assume they can't do the job based on their judgement of that person's disability rather than ability.   what if someone has normal cognitive functions, but their physical impairment is such that they will need special accommodations at the office or will take a longer time to do their work or will have a hard time properly communicating with their coworkers?   &gt;the employer should not have the right to discriminate on that basis.   employers shouldn't have the right to make the choice on who they think is the best fit for the job? why even have interviews then we can just look at cvs?   people discriminate constantly, they see a person with a disability and they know that person will have a harder time than someone with the same qualifications and no disabilities so why would they logically go through the trouble?     &gt;now as you say we know, in practice, that is not true. like with mental health or women or ethnicity, some employers will make those decisions whether there is legislation there to protect against discrimination or not, and say they just were not the preferred candidate.    well yes, protected classes are really a pointless concept because there is still de facto discrimination and there will always be because people make choices and judgements about other people based on both objective (2:1 hons from lse, internship at a prestigious company) and subjective (half black wheelchair bound religious jewish cross dresser with a polish accent) factors.   &gt;but at the point of being accepted for interview, you as a disabled person should feel no less welcome to take that role than someone not in a wheelchair, or with ms, or deaf, if your skills are the same.   well nobody will know unless you tell them before they see you, but it's naive to think that your disability won't be taken into account in the hiring process and how you're perceived and it's asking people to reject their nature as humans (aka asking too much) to expect them to make judgements about employment without taking who you are outside of your qualifications into consideration.    &gt;i've worked with people with physical disabilities, previous mental health or substance abuse issues and they have been as capable of doing the job, sometime with adjustments, but i think that is fair. i think it would be a shame if we discouraged those people from feeling welcome into the job market or education. not only does it lower their value to themselves and society, it takes control out of their hands, which i think it where the idea of ableism comes from.   well i mean they have to be prepared and accept that they do have a disability which is a negative thing that counts against them and with that they should realise that it will be harder for them in certain aspects of life because there are plenty of people with average qualifications who don't have a disability and thus have less baggage so they're going to have to go above and beyond average to balance out the disability and have the same opportunities as the average non-disabled person.",1,,-1

527455,"exactly. intimacy should know no bounds- or rather it shouldn't be bounded, but just be.   everyone is disabled in some way, or better yet, everyone has special needs. if you don't think you have special needs than that's a damn high and mighty statement. i have a friend who has extensively worked with ""special needs"" kids in a classroom setting, and that is one of the greatest lessons she brought back to teach me. no one is 100% emotionally sound,  mentally sound, or even physically sound. speaking as someone who is also on disability, i know as well. the phrase is handicapable not handicapped  mental disability is often looked at like it is the patient's fault, so i see lots of perspectives here when considering this too. you can easily become an emotional caretaker as you might become a physical caretaker, yet people don't always hesitate as much when someone has mental health issues partially because of society and sometimes we may not be aware.  allergies can kill me but people see that as more ""normal"" even though it is a very real disability. if i get stung by a bee, and don't have my shot, i will die. i know they are not the exact same thing, but there is no need to belittle the larger point here. the reality is that we can all have much in common even with people that we label for medical purposes, whatever those may be, because we label them for that- medical purposes. being confined to medicines or a wheelchair, or even a bed, doesn't mean you have to be defined by it.  instead of using the labels to distance ourselves, we might strive to see the similarities. humanity reaches much further than these labels, and it years to be pushed beyond these labels as well.  do you really think that people are simply the sum of their labels? why not let the person in question decide their boundaries. if my friend who recently finished his last round of chemo for cancer of his bones after serving in the air guard let himself be defined by his labels, he would have never walked again. yet he pushed and pushed and can play basketball again despite what everyone told him. just like a relationship that people deem couldn't work due to a physical disability, it is up to the people in question whether it will work, not reddit. we are here to give advice. my advice is to try to relate rather than distance.   when my friend was wheelchair ridden and may have never been able to walk again, you know what his friends did? they put him on their shoulders and played basketball. he told me this was one of the brightest beacons of hope and greatest gifts he could have been given in order to continue to push himself. when people came in and did what they thought they should do for someone wheelchair bound, ie read to him, he became instantly angry and extremely depressed.   so op, try to see the similarities from both rational and empathetic points of view first. it is easy to see the differences, but maybe you will find yourself surprised by the similarities and your answer clearer.  u/kitkat1934 i appreciate your perspective on wording. however not only were those issues not my exact focus, but i never intended to claim, nor did claim, that disabilities are not a real issue,  or that people who do not use the same language or sentiment as i did would somehow hold the opposite sentiment, or that they are defining themselves by a label. that is bonkers, but granted you have a point on my words, and a good one that i can still learn from- i must admit i was speaking from passion and used misnomers before. i actually did google what you said, and it makes sense and i have learned something. thanks friend!  the original point is so op doesn't see it as only from the perspective of disability, but with an argument or perhaps several of their own, inspired, yes self inspired, but some of a different pattern of thinking than is already here bc ultimately op is filled with questions already. may these ideas be a jumping board for that thought, or not:  edit  in the fewest words i can manage, for op, i simply contend that the following examples may apply  1) there are many people with disabilities who may live their lives without knowing   2) just because everyone has shirt doesn't make the one you are wearing any less yours is the like saying everyone has a disability   3) no one should define themselves by a label  4) the idea that no body is perfect does not mean that we should simply say ""oh everyone is the same"". rather it means that we should encourage differences and diversity in order to grow and understand. ""nobody"" is different than saying ""no body"" however small a difference. if anything this is a call to judge people more, but according to ways that are correct and healthy. it is the same way that colorblindness towards race cannot exist if we want to be accepting of different cultures and ways of life. we humans are capable of this rational and reasoned type of emotion and experience.  5) so especially in context with 4, relate, do not distance. relate in not-relating and relate in relating. it is all the same in the end, but distance is what kills any chance of communication, and distancing is easy. although keep in mind that distancing is not the same as relating by learning how you are different.   6) only you know the true answer whatever truth it is you determine",1,,1

how about differently abled . i've heard them called that. differently abled! you can't even call these people handicapped anymore. they'll say, ""were not handicapped. were handicapable!"" these poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition, somehow you'll change the condition. well, hey cousin, ppsssspptttttt. doesn't happen. doesn't happen. we have no more deaf people in this country, hearing impaired.   no ones blind anymore, partially sighted or visually impaired. we have no more stupid people. everyone has a learning disorder...or he's minimally exceptional. how would you like to be told that about your child?

[here](http://thedigitalcommons.org/docs/shakespeare_social-model-of-disability.pdf) is a written primer and history on the social model of disability, it has a lot of references you can read and is written by tom shakespeare, who is a notable disability studies scholar. the social model came from a british organisation called 'the union of the physically impaired against segregation' and was explictly discussed during a meeting ([minutes](https://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/library/upias-fundamental-principles.pdf)) in 1975 in which the actvists discussed (in part) the following point:  ""1. fundamental principles to which we are both in agreement: disability is a situation, caused by social conditions, which requires for its elimination, (a) that no one aspect such as incomes, mobility or institutions is treated in isolation, (b) that disabled people should, with the advice and help of others, assume control over their own lives, and (c) that professionals, experts and others who seek to help must be committed to promoting such control by disabled people.""  this formed the basis of the social model of disability which has informed disability civil rights activism right up until today.  various activists - including simi linton ([youtube lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2ro2v3kdgi)) have explictly used the social model to launch off of and discuss wider social interactions with disablity and disabled people. there are social science focused societites ([dsq](https://dsq-sds.org/)) that have a very keen on focus on disability as a *social construct* and it's a field of academia in it's own right.  [this (free) reader](https://icpla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/davis-l.-the-disability-studies.pdf) by lennard davis (himself coda- child of deaf adult) is also a really good jumping off point.  disability civil rights as a movement also associated with disability-led art, with direct action (physically doing something, like chaining yourself to a bus) being born out of the nexus of art, disability and acitvism.  that's probably enough to go on?  secondly:  &gt;what are your thoughts on reclaiming words like ""cripple"" as a way to talk about ourselves within our communities?  i use cripple (as evidenced by my username) but i did not use it until i became physically impaired. as a word that the physically impaired use to problematise the reactions of the nonphysically impaired to their impairment - for example, use of the word 'cripple' when applied to the self can highlight the needless discomfort of an able bodied person if i am unable to perform a task, and their negative reaction might open the conversation as to why they are discomforted - in that context i think the word is fine.  it, to me, tears away the facade of 'productivity' and 'inspiration' (see, [stella young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxrs7-i_smq&amp;t=1s)) placed upon many physically disabled people if you use a word like cripple and punctuate assumptions of capability and the moral good associated with it.  but, as a general word to apply to all disabled people i'd take issue with it, as not all disabled people are physically impaired, and although i can see the use case for it as an act of solidarity it hits very differently when that word is a word that you have either had thrown at you as a slur personally, or (like i was) was afraid of becoming. there's a certain element of gallows humour to it, and when a nonphysically impaired person uses it, it can feel appropiative in the same way as a cognitively typical person trying to reclaim the r-word would.  when using to describe others, just be careful - some people are offended by it, as is their right to be, so much like queer don't assume others have comfort with what is in essence still a fairly radical reclamation as it disrupts traditional ideas of being capable by essentially bringing some nuance to the social model and pointing out the idea of inherent imparment which is still uncomfortable to disabled people who have fought their entire lives to be seen as capable.  edit: disability culture is very similar to the idea of deafworld or culturally deaf, this is a fairly new concept in critical disability studies, but i would broadly agree that there is a cultural heritage to being disabled at least in the western world/anglocentric spaces",1,,1

634105,"here is a list of what author, inventor and futurist raymond kurzweil said will happen by/around 2019 (from *the age of spiritual machines*).    * a $1,000 personal computer has as much raw power as the human brain. * the summed computational powers of all computers is comparable to the total brainpower of the human race. * computers are embedded everywhere in the environment (inside of furniture, jewelry, walls, clothing, etc.). * people experience 3-d virtual reality through glasses and contact lenses that beam images directly to their retinas (retinal display). coupled with an auditory source (headphones), users can remotely communicate with other people and access the internet.  * these special glasses and contact lenses can deliver ""augmented reality"" and ""virtual reality"" in three different ways. first, they can project ""heads-up-displays"" (huds) across the user's field of vision, superimposing images that stay in place in the environment regardless of the user's perspective or orientation. second, virtual objects or people could be rendered in fixed locations by the glasses, so when the user's eyes look elsewhere, the objects appear to stay in their places. third, the devices could block out the ""real"" world entirely and fully immerse the user in a virtual reality environment. * people communicate with their computers via two-way speech and gestures instead of with keyboards. furthermore, most of this interaction occurs through computerized assistants with different personalities that the user can select or customize. dealing with computers thus becomes more and more like dealing with a human being. * most business transactions or information inquiries involve dealing with a simulated person. * most people own more than one pc, though the concept of what a ""computer"" is has changed considerably: computers are no longer limited in design to laptops or cpus contained in a large box connected to a monitor. instead, devices with computer capabilities come in all sorts of unexpected shapes and sizes. * cables connecting computers and peripherals have almost completely disappeared. * rotating computer hard drives are no longer used. * three-dimensional nanotube lattices are the dominant computing substrate. * massively parallel neural nets and genetic algorithms are in wide use. * destructive scans of the brain and noninvasive brain scans have allowed scientists to understand the brain much better. the algorithms that allow the relatively small genetic code of the brain to construct a much more complex organ are being transferred into computer neural nets. * pinhead-sized cameras are everywhere. * nanotechnology is more capable and is in use for specialized applications, yet it has not yet made it into the mainstream. ""nanoengineered machines"" begin to be used in manufacturing. * thin, lightweight, handheld displays with very high resolutions are the preferred means for viewing documents. the aforementioned computer eyeglasses and contact lenses are also used for this same purpose, and all download the information wirelessly. * computers have made paper books and documents almost completely obsolete. * most learning is accomplished through intelligent, adaptive courseware presented by computer-simulated teachers. in the learning process, human adults fill the counselor and mentor roles instead of being academic instructors. these assistants are often not physically present, and help students remotely. * students still learn together and socialize, though this is often done remotely via computers. * all students have access to computers. * most human workers spend the majority of their time acquiring new skills and knowledge. * blind people wear special glasses that interpret the real world for them through speech. sighted people also use these glasses to amplify their own abilities. * retinal and neural implants also exist, but are in limited use because they are less useful. * deaf people use special glasses that convert speech into text or signs, and music into images or tactile sensations. cochlear and other implants are also widely used. * people with spinal cord injuries can walk and climb steps using computer-controlled nerve stimulation and exoskeletal robotic walkers. computers are also found inside of some humans in the form of cybernetic implants. these are most commonly used by disabled people to regain normal physical faculties (i.e. - retinal implants allow the blind to see and spinal implants coupled with mechanical legs allow the paralyzed to walk). language translating machines are of much higher quality, and are routinely used in conversations. * effective language technologies (natural language processing, speech recognition, speech synthesis) exist * access to the internet is completely wireless and provided by wearable or implanted computers. * people are able to wirelessly access the internet at all times from almost anywhere * devices that deliver sensations to the skin surface of their users (i.e.--tight body suits and gloves) are also sometimes used in virtual reality to complete the experience. ""virtual sex""--in which two people are able to have sex with each other through virtual reality, or in which a human can have sex with a ""simulated"" partner that only exists on a computer‚Äîbecomes a reality. * just as visual- and auditory virtual reality have come of age, haptic technology has fully matured and is completely convincing, yet requires the user to enter a v.r. booth. it is commonly used for computer sex and remote medical examinations. it is the preferred sexual medium since it is safe and enhances the experience. * worldwide economic growth has continued. there has not been a global economic collapse. * the vast majority of business interactions occur between humans and simulated retailers, or between a human's virtual personal assistant and a simulated retailer. * household robots are ubiquitous and reliable. * computers do most of the vehicle driving‚Äî-humans are in fact prohibited from driving on highways unassisted. furthermore, when humans do take over the wheel, the onboard computer system constantly monitors their actions and takes control whenever the human drives recklessly. as a result, there are very few transportation accidents. most roads now have automated driving systems‚Äînetworks of monitoring and communication devices that allow computer-controlled automobiles to safely navigate. * prototype personal flying vehicles using microflaps exist. they are also primarily computer-controlled. * humans are beginning to have deep relationships with automated personalities, which hold some advantages over human partners. the depth of some computer personalities convinces some people that they should be accorded more rights. * while a growing number of humans believe that their computers and the simulated personalities they interact with are intelligent to the point of human-level consciousness, experts dismiss the possibility that any could pass the turing test. * human-robot relationships begin as simulated personalities become more convincing. * interaction with virtual personalities becomes a primary interface public places and workplaces are ubiquitously monitored to prevent violence and all actions are recorded permanently. personal privacy is a major political issue, and some people protect themselves with unbreakable computer codes. * the basic needs of the underclass are met.

628980,"partially because doctors don't know where the line would be drawn. how do you quantify the quality of a human life? how do you predict if an infant will be miserable later in life?   i have worked with many special needs children and my sister has down syndome along with having a hole in her heart when she was born. i can tell you some of those disabled children know how to enjoy life and have a higher quality of life than ""normal ppl/children"".    so if your going on quality of life you'd also have to allow assisted suicides of the elderly, mentally ill, and those who were injured or paralyzed later in life. the irony is many supporters forget this, they are willing do overlook the quality of life in an unborn child with a debilitating disability, however would be against assisted suicide of those they know with a very low quality of life.   generally as people get older, most people want to live. some are suicidal granted, but even those severely disabled generally have a will to live. how are they, tho unborn, different from someone disabled do to age?   in addition often doctors are wrong and will severely underestimate what the human body and spirit is capable of. i know stories of ppl who survived cancer who were told they would die. also people who were paralyzed who healed and learned to walk. the best doctors can do is give an educated guess based on experience.   long story short, most parents with disabled children have accepted the child and decided they love them no matter what.  many even consider the idea of killing or aborting the disabled to be the care taker not willing to accept the responsibility of the life being brought into the world, to be selfish, regardless of the child's or parents ability. that because the child is not what they expected for themself, the child is undesirable.   so if you agree with killing disabled infants or aborting a disabled fetus, at the very least do not mascerade that it is for the baby. one usually aborts a disabled child for onesself.    edit. formatting on phone, sry    edit 2. also for patents with a child born lacking brain activity or who can't breathe on their own- it's no different than a child in a coma after  a car crash. the parents hold out hope for a miracle. it's so very hard to let go.",1,,1

614378,"the article's quite poor.  it doesn't give any information about how pi would actually be computed to so many decimal places.  it could easily have talked about how to compute pi using the arctan series, arctan(x) = x - x^3/3 + x^5/5 - x^7/7 + x^9/9, ... and identities such as pi/4 = 4 arctan(1/5) - arctan(1/239).  with this formula, and an extended-precision arithmetic package, one can easily compute pi to thousands of decimal places.     see, for example, http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath373.htm  another method for computing pi is the ""arithmetic-geometric mean"" iteration -- see the book by the borweins, ""pi and the agm"".    yet another method computes the n'th binary digit of pi using very small space (informally:  ""without computing all the previous digits"").  see, for example, http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/ .   the small space bound is dependent on an unproved conjecture, however.  the article also doesn't mention why one would want to compute so many digits.  there are at least two reasons:  it is still an unsolved problem whether pi is ""normal"", that is, whether every block of k digits appears with a limiting frequency that one would expect from a random sequence.  it is even unknown whether every block of digits appears somewhere in the decimal expansion of pi (popular claims to the contrary notwithstanding).  most mathematicians believe the answer to both problems is ""yes"".   it is at least conceivable that computing huge numbers of digits of pi could suggest whether these conjectures are true.  the second reason is that computing large numbers of digits of pi, since they intensively use various arithmetic operations, could reveal problems with new computer chips -- you can compare the results of your calculation to previous ones.  neither reason is truly compelling, though.",0,,
732487,"one issue is that ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù and ‚Äúis a disability‚Äù have different meanings.  you do not feel ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù, as it is commonly phrased, signifying *unable to hold employment full-time.*   there is sort of this legal definition, and so ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù has taken on this added meaning of having a disability *so severe it precludes someone‚Äôs ability to do work.* but ‚Äòdisabled‚Äô means more than that.    some autistic people do qualify for this definition, because sensory processing for them can be so severe, or their auditory process struggles, or their eating is so restricted, or they cannot move well due to low muscle tone and poor propioception. they may have long periods of communicating not through spoken word, and this makes employment difficult. anxiety, social interaction panic can also take a toll on their health.  but ‚Äúhas a disability‚Äù is different than ‚Äúlegally government-disabled and fully unable to work.‚Äù   26% of adults have a disability. these are the things that you mentioned, of needing to work a little bit harder at. you have a natural difficulty reading nonverbal cues. something small, but not disabling enough not to be able to work at all, is a disability. there are extremely successful people in their careers who have dyslexia - they have a disability, but are not ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù from work due to it.   someone with arthritis of the hands has a disability. they can still work ‚Äòwith a disability.‚Äô  asthma is a disability, diabetes is a disability.  13% of adults have difficulty climbing stairs due to medical conditions. 10% have a learning or cognition disability. 6% of adults are deaf or hoh (hard of hearing.)  looking at it, beethoven was a composer who wrote music while deaf. he had a disability, he was still able to do big things.   olympic athletes have had physical disabilities florence joyner, fastest track runner, had asthma. one gymnast, george eyser, won 6 olympic medals in a day - while having one fully intact leg (his left leg was amputated in a train accident.) jim abbott placed baseball with one hand. im dong-hyun won gold in archery while being legally blind in one eye. natalia partyka competed in the olympics for table tennis, while being born with only a left hand. her right arm ended around the elbow.   so people can have disabilities and still live ‚Äònormal‚Äô lives. they can even live extraordinarily lives. and like you mentioned, their disabilities can also be their advantages - one deaf olympic fencer said that having silence was an advantage in his sport.   several us presidents have had disabilities: teddy roosevelt and asthma, fdr and polio (suspected guillaume barre), john f. kennedy and addison‚Äôs, the current president and stuttering.   george washington had gone through every communicable disease in existence - smallpox, malaria, tb, dysentery - and had lasting disabilities from it. james madison had malaria, seizures, arthritis, and childhood ailments that left him hovering around 100lbs, 5‚Äô4‚Äù. he had to choose his college based on his illnesses.   so having a disability doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt do anything - people who are famous for what they‚Äôve done have had disabilities. they‚Äôve rode into battle, led large groups, and won athletic competitions against able-bodied people (with a disability).   to have a disability is to be human.",1,,2

182758,"(courtesy of sports illustrated)  i try to be a good father. give my kids mulligans. work nights to pay for their text messaging. take them to swimsuit shoots.  but compared with dick hoyt, i suck.  eighty-five times he's pushed his disabled son, rick, 26.2 miles in marathons. eight times he's not only pushed him 26.2 miles in a wheelchair but also towed him 2.4 miles in a dinghy while swimming and pedaled him 112 miles in a seat on the handlebars--all in the same day.  dick's also pulled him cross-country skiing, taken him on his back mountain climbing and once hauled him across the u.s. on a bike. makes taking your son bowling look a little lame, right?  and what has rick done for his father? not much--except save his life. this love story began in winchester , mass. , 43 years ago, when rick was strangled by the umbilical cord during birth, leaving him brain-damaged and unable to control his limbs.  ""he'll be a vegetable the rest of his life;'' dick says doctors told him and his wife, judy, when rick was nine months old. ``put him in an institution.''  but the hoyts weren't buying it. they noticed the way rick's eyes followed them around the room. when rick was 11 they took him to the engineering department at tufts university and asked if there was anything to help the boy communicate. ``no way,'' dick says he was told. ``there's nothing going on in his brain.''  ""tell him a joke,'' dick countered. they did. rick laughed. turns out a lot was going on in his brain. rigged up with a computer that allowed him to control the cursor by touching a switch with the side of his head, rick was finally able to communicate. first words? ``go bruins!'' and after a high school classmate was paralyzed in an accident and the school organized a charity run for him, rick pecked out, ``dad, i want to do that.''  yeah, right. how was dick, a self-described ``porker'' who never ran more than a mile at a time, going to push his son five miles? still, he tried. ``then it was me who was handicapped,'' dick says. ``i was sore for two weeks.''  that day changed rick's life. ``dad,'' he typed, ``when we were running, it felt like i wasn't disabled anymore!''  and that sentence changed dick's life. he became obsessed with giving rick that feeling as often as he could. he got into such hard-belly shape that he and rick were ready to try the 1979 boston marathon.  ``no way,'' dick was told by a race official. the hoyts weren't quite a single runner, and they weren't quite a wheelchair competitor. for a few years dick and rick just joined the massive field and ran anyway, then they found a way to get into the race officially: in 1983 they ran another marathon so fast they made the qualifying time for boston the following year.  then somebody said, ``hey, dick, why not a triathlon?''  how's a guy who never learned to swim and hadn't ridden a bike since he was six going to haul his 110-pound kid through a triathlon? still, dick tried.  now they've done 212 triathlons, including four grueling 15-hour ironmans in hawaii . it must be a buzzkill to be a 25-year-old stud getting passed by an old guy towing a grown man in a dinghy, don't you think?  hey, dick, why not see how you'd do on your own? ``no way,'' he says. dick does it purely for ``the awesome feeling'' he gets seeing rick with a cantaloupe smile as they run, swim and ride together.  this year, at ages 65 and 43, dick and rick finished their 24th boston marathon, in 5,083rd place out of more than 20,000 starters. their best time? two hours, 40 minutes in 1992--only 35 minutes off the world record, which, in case you don't keep track of these things, happens to be held by a guy who was not pushing another man in a wheelchair at the time.  ``no question about it,'' rick types. ``my dad is the father of the century.''  and dick got something else out of all this too. two years ago he had a mild heart attack during a race. doctors found that one of his arteries was 95% clogged. ``if you hadn't been in such great shape,'' one doctor told him, ``you probably would've died 15 years ago.'' so, in a way, dick and rick saved each other's life.  rick, who has his own apartment (he gets home care) and works in boston, and dick, retired from the military and living in holland, mass. , always find ways to be together. they give speeches around the country and compete in some backbreaking race every weekend, including this father's day.  that night, rick will buy his dad dinner, but the thing he really wants to give him is a gift he can never buy.  ``the thing i'd most like,'' rick types, ``is that my dad sit in the chair and i push him once.''",1,2,2

797203,"that seems to be the case because disability doesn't have to be a bad thing or a struggle. most folks who are born non-able bodied (blind, deaf, visually impaired, hard of hearing, wheelchair folks, autism, you name it) are fine being that way and see it as a part of themselves or their identity. deaf people can communicate with lip reading and sign language, individuals with visual impairments have braile, and we have technologically advanced power wheelchairs for people who don't have mobility in their legs. people with autism who are verbal can live relatively normal lives (aside from the comorbid conditions, increased risk of suicide due to loneliness etc), and those that aren't can communicate with alternative methods such as technology or sign language. even most people with cancer tumors recover and get to live full lives, the remission rates are 80%.  i think your guilt comes form society's assumption that disability is some sort of terrible thing that we need to get rid of, when really most people born disabled are fine or even proud being that way, and those who become disabled later in life usually adjust to it and live productive lives thanks to neuroplasticity. getting rid of disability, if we could find a way to detect which babies will turn out disabled , especially deafness and autism perhaps, would be a loss of culture.  i will give an example.  my cousin has moderate down's syndrome. she is intelligent enough to go to a special school, get a degree in informatics, paint handmade t-shirts which she sells and star in amateur theater. she is also intelligent enough to know something is different about her, and she is mostly content and happy with it, because she was born with it, it's part of who she is, part of her identity. on the other hand my mom suffered from ms which is a very serious and debilitating disease of the nervous system, which caused her immense physical pain and eventually she needed to use a motor wheelchair to be able to have some sort of mobility or indepdence. i can see how the later, being born able bodied but becoming disabled later in life due to health complications would suck a lot, and the adjustment period would suck even more, but most people born with their conditions which are considered disabling are fine/proud being that way, because if they weren't they would not be them.   i think your guilt comes form society's assumption that disability is some sort of terrible thing that we need to get rid of, when really most people born disabled are fine or even proud being that way, and those who become disabled later in life usually adjust to it and live productive lives thanks to neuroplasticity. getting rid of disability, if we could find a way to detect which babies will turn out disabled ,especially deafness andn autism perhaps, would be a loss of culture.   disability is neither good nor bad, it is just neutral, it can either be a terrible debilitating struggle acquired later in life, or it can be a neutral, alright happy life circumstance which some people are born with.   i will give you a milder example, for instance i have adhd. adhd is a learning disability in the sense that ppl w/ it lack an ability that other individuals have, regulating where their attention goes. luckily it's extremely treatable with medication and the behavioral interventions for it work pretty well, but not everyone has access to treatment. there are difficulties we face because of society's unwillingness to accomondate different ways of being (much like wheelchair users with stairs everywhere, or deaf people who need subtitles to watch youtube), but the idea of getting rid of my adhd scares me because i have been this way since i could form memories and i would have to alter a very big aspect of my mind and who i am if i hypothetically wanted to ''cure'' it. i would rather more accomondating workplaces and school systems.  op, give yourself some kindness. your post history says you're schizophrenic and if that's the case then you have no reason to feel invalidated, this is one of the most horrible conditions a person can suffer with, and one of the complications is suicide. i think you would really be interested in learning about the concept of ''invisible disability'', disabling conditions which create differences in a persons everyday life but are not visible to the naked eye, so society treats them as lesser or irrelevant. some of these include autism, chronic pain, ceirtain autoimmune conditions, epilepsy, mental illness, and included in the latter category, schizophrenia.   btw: not all people with visible, obvious to the naked eye disabilities are happy or content. michael scott valsavori, one of adam maier clayton's dearest friends (you have made posts about him in the past) had a very rare stroke as a kid which left him unable to move his legs or arms and while according to his facebook he seemed to have a wife and life going somewhere for him he still didn't want to go on and knew that since he was like, 12.   tldr: disability is neither good nor bad, but can be either of those depennding on the circumstances, and seeing it as some sort of tragedy creates guilt to those with invisible, very stigmatized, poorly understood conditions.",1,,0

247677,"my few complaints:  1) it's a scientific fact that sugar causes cancer, strokes, heart attacks, diabetes and a miriad of other things. i'm male i have a roughly 60% chance of dying from a heart attack, perhaps on the off chance aspartame does cause cancer it might happen at a later date than my heart attack would.  2) aspartame tests are complete crap. they have so many unknown variables in and are mere statistics. the main problem is its breakdown into methyl alcohol, which happens at a lower rate than is acceptable in alcoholic drinks and poses no risk. it is also a natural byproduct of metabolism in humans, and unless it is in a large amount it has no effect.  3) the only test i've seen that resulted in death was performed on a rat when it was fed 30 times its bodyweight and *starved*. surely that's a pro for a diet drink?!!  4) sodium benzoate is actually the thing that damages your mitochondrial dna, it binds with it and irreprably changes sections that cause mitochondrial death; these mitochondria are passed on by women to their children. so **why** doesn't it say that?! i'm posting the major side effect, because the article gives a bunch of maybes. sodium benzoate is a **mutagen**.  5) phosphoric acid is contained in normal coke, and it's even more damaging to someones teeth in ordinary coke because it both removes your teeth's protection and dumps a load of sugar onto your teeth promoting bacterial growth. diet coke is actually reccomended by dentists as a switch, they prefer you switch to water but as if, and then suggest you have something after it that's alkaline, or even just chew gum because it promotes salivation that reduces the acid. this bit of information came straight from my doctor a few months ago.  6) [benzene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benzene_in_soft_drinks#environmental_exposure_to_benzene) exposure in drinks is insignificant. if you live in a city, you'd need to drink 10 litres of coke a day to equal the amount you breathe. filling your cars gas tank is about equivalent to a 330ml can of coke. the intestine and stomach are protective against carcinogens as your intestine continaully sheds its surface layer, your lungs don't! so even if you did drink 10 litres of coke a day, you wouldn't be nearly as bad off as you are breathing city air. got a problem with benzene in your coke? move out of the city!  7) number 7 is lucky, so this ones just for the sake of saying i have a problem with the whole damn article!",1,,0

475540,"&gt;auxiv  &gt;whats happening now in our society is this: [secularization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secularization) i havent been to church in years myself. my concern is for the kids, and society as a whole. society is straying further from basic principals. i believe single parents, kids having kids, and homosexuality are leading factors in the degradation of our society. i was born in the early 70's. i grew up in a time when kids didnt bring guns to school and shoot everyone, and all the other nonsense that is going on with our younger generation these days. all these are contributing factors in the decline and degradation of society as a whole. to allow ""out of the norm"" breeds more ""out of the norm"". you call it progress, i call it a bunch of people who cant accept rules that were handed down from generations past. the further we stray from these basic ""rules"" and ideologies, the further society will stray from basic moral principals. people are trying to raise their kids in this mess. they see marriage of gays as another milestone further away from a healthy society, in which their kids must grow up and live. ps. you should tell your wife you're gay.  in regards to your childish ps note telling me to tell my wife that i'm gay, i need to ask you this: standing up for the freedoms and equality of everyone makes me gay?  i personally feel that people of all ages, backgrounds, skin tones, sexes, and sexual orientations should have equal rights and treatment, and that somehow makes me gay?  your statements are only proving you're a close-minded bigot.  different sexual orientations are nothing new, as homosexuality was around even before the days of greece.  it's obviously a part of humanity, and just because you disagree with that fact does not make you right above everyone else.  and you're concern is for the children?  you're still a close-minded bigot.  there has never been any evidence suggesting that the degradation of our society is directly linked to homosexuality, single-parent families, etc.  let's just say that there are case studies that state otherwise.  we can easily argue right back against it.  was there mass chaos in our society back in wwii, when mothers were forced to raise their children alone because their husband's had died in the war?  nope, just the same routine problems society faces.  homosexuality was a closed topic back in the early part of the 20th century, but it was slowly emerging.  just because it wasn't a frequently as discussed topic today as it was back then, doesn't undermine the fact that there were homosexuals.  so according to your pathetic, childish argument, the frequency of people admitting they're gay is contributing to the downfall of our country?  by that logic, children admitting that they want to be astronauts or firemen would contribute to the fixing of our nation's problems.  and that's why you're clearly wrong.  people admitting who they are isn't doing the damage, as there is no substantial connection.  instead, maybe we should actually blame the *real* problems?  for example, we have corrupt politicians taking bribes to alter laws.  our laws, every year, keep compounding on top of one another, making the law difficult and confusing.  that's why our forefathers had the simple style of government: so that things would run and be handled more easily and efficiently.  also, let's not forget the pressures our schools and system put on our youth, or the fact that our schools only function as well as the amount of funding they get [i.e., poor neighborhoods receive little].  you need to stop blaming homosexuality as some sort of ""megasource"" of problems and face up to the fact that there are other factors at play.  and where in our constitution does it state we're supposed to stick to these ""basic rules"" and ""idealogies"" you seem to make mention of?  you're definitely wrong, as the treaty of tripoli, specifically article 11, states that there is a separation of church and state in our government.  so you're wrong, there was no religious foundation from our nation that we're straying away from.  and even more importantly, is that religion does not equate to level of morality.  child molestation has been documented from the catholic church in this nation for well over 100 years.  and that's just one example...  you have no evidence supporting your argument, and there's plenty of evidence and strong argument against it.  stop criticizing the things you have a prejudice for, and maybe focus more on the *actual* problems contributing the downfall of our civilizations.  not everything in the world is the way you perceive it.",0,,

249747,"you misunderstand, and should probably take time to learn about the perspectives of other human beings before suggesting they are objectively defective.  the issue with ‚Äúdisability‚Äù is that it's the result of our idea about ‚Äúability,‚Äù which changes over time and which some academics argue is a relatively recent cultural construct. the story they tell is this: when statistics came around in the 19th century, people started forming ideas about what was ""normal"" because now we had stats to place people on a bell curve (normal) or off a bell curve (abnormal). this idea then combined with the eugenics of the early 20th, resulting in ideas about how non-disabled people, or the able-bodied, were ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù while disabled people were ‚Äúabnormal.‚Äù  the primary issue with this is the whole construct remains dependent upon eugenic ideas, which are inherently flawed because they claim false support in darwin's theory of evolution. in fact, the theory of evolution does not support eugenic ideals because eugenics misunderstands natural selection. eugenics suggests that individuals can be perfectly adapted to an environment, and thus fit an assumed biological ideal (able-bodiedness), but the human environment is neither uniform nor constant, making it impossible for any person to remain ‚Äúideal‚Äù in such a dynamic environment. also, evolution is about change in populations over time, not individuals, so the entire idea really just falls to pieces.   of course, while it‚Äôs helpful to point out the logical fallacies in able-bodiedness and how it‚Äôs not actually ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù when we see someone who we label disabled struggling in an able-bodied society we tend look as disability theorists and say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt seriously tell me that their situation is preferable to my own.‚Äù in fact we can, because such statements come from a misunderstanding about how able-bodiedness changes over time and how this affects the relationship between people and their environment.  we tend to imagine what is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is constant, but this is not so, especially with regards to able-bodiedness in the age of modern medicine. instead, we are in a never ending race to keep up with able-bodiedness. for example, every new drug that treats a disease or disorder raises the bar for the rest of us. you get depressed sometimes? you‚Äôre not sad, you‚Äôre depressed. you can‚Äôt focus? you aren‚Äôt flighty, you have adhd. your legs are twitchy? you don‚Äôt have muscle spasms, you have restless leg syndrome. let me qualify that criticism by saying that absolutely, these  are real issues that negatively impact the lives of real people, but the way we play them out in our culture, we don‚Äôt treat just those who will greatly benefit from the drug. as the bar gets higher, we treat those who will greatly benefit, and then we treat everyone and their mother. in this way, our environment changes and we expect people to change their own bodies to adapt. and as we get better at making new drugs, this standard will change even faster.   this is all complicated by ideas about accommodation of disability. my favorite example is the american athlete and fashion model aimee mullins. aimee is a double amputee who uses prostheses that allow her to run competitively. before prosthetics, aimee would have been wheelchair bound, but with accommodation by her prostheses, she can run. she can also remove her running prosthetics and put of decorative prosthetics formed from materials such as glass, wood, etc. that, in the past, have allowed her to work as a fashion model showing off poses and materials that a person with full length biological legs cannot. that is to say, with regards to the ability to model these materials, aimee can engage in activities that most people cannot. relative to aimee and with regards to her modeling, most of us are disabled.  while that example may seem farfetched, it demonstrates the importance of the idea that whether or not one is able-bodied or disabled is context-specific, and it‚Äôs not always black and white. a more everyday example is glasses: a good pair of glasses can act as a class symbol, improving how a person is perceived. personally, i am in graduate school for science and i look older, more serious and frankly more attractive when i wear my glasses, so i wear them often. i‚Äôve also met people who have worn glasses that did not have a prescription, and they were obvious enough for the rest of us to realize, at which point they were made fun of until they took them off. because of a perceived biological disability (bad eyesight), and because of the social stigma against the perceived douchebaggery of non-prescription glasses, my disability, once accommodated, is actually an advantage in my environment.   quite simply, it is extremely difficult to come up with sound arguments for why one combination of biological characteristics is superior to another. increased longevity is one most people agree on, but the real debate is about quality of life. presumably, the ability to do more ‚Äústuff‚Äù is an increase in quality of life, while the inability is a decrease, but previous examples demonstrate it‚Äôs not so black-and-white. in the example of the deaf community (note: ‚Äúdeaf‚Äù is what ‚Äúhearing‚Äù people call people who cannot hear, while ‚Äúdeaf‚Äù is the culture of ‚Äúdeaf‚Äù people), i‚Äôve read of situations in which deaf people with unwanted implants felt that deaf culture‚Äôs relatively increased emphasis on both the visual aspects of life as well as the accompanying silence made life without implants preferable, causing me to question the hearing world‚Äôs habit of making the decision for hearing impaired children.   tl;dr normal is a social construct, as is disabled. environment changes too much for anyone to be a physical ideal, and in the modern era our dependence on technology is making us into demi-cyborgs, so rather than saying some people are disabled, or biologically dysfunctional, we should consider technological accommodation as a less invasive, diversity-preserving alternative.",1,,1
927045,"i don't have children but i am disabled myself, as are many of my friends.  i hope to be a parent someday and there is a very good chance that my kid will have a disability, and i'm ok with that.  the way i see parenthood is this: you don't know what you're going to get. when you choose to become a parent, you must choose to be a parent regardless.   you might get a kid just like you, or nothing like you. you might get a kid born with a disability. you might get a kid born with a health condition that leads to a very early death. you might get a kid who develops normally and then becomes schizophrenic at age 18, or who is paralyzed in a car crash at 25, or who gets cancer at 7. and, by the way, any of these things could also happen to you or your spouse. (some disabled people refer to the non-disabled as ""temporarily able-bodied"", because if you live long enough, most people become disabled in one way or another.)   you might get an able-bodied, neurotypical kid who turns out to be a huge asshole regardless of how you raise him. your kid might be bullied or be a bully, get murdered or murder someone else's kid. you don't know. if you think you can't deal with all the possibilities, don't have a kid.   and, by the way, disability is not always the tragic devestating shit the media and most of society tells you. disabled people have just as much intrinsic human value as everyone else, and just as much capability to bring others joy and pain as any other person.  the developmental disabilties act tells us that ""disability is a natural part of the human experience"".",1,,1
829217,"i'm not a mother of a disabled child, but my twin sister and i have diplegic cp, so i have a close connection to the disability (and my parents who raised us)   for the points asked, i was quite the floppy baby ! however, i behaved and crawled normally, and it wasn't until i could only walk with assistance that my parents noticed something was up. of course, prolonged stretching of my legs made them twitch and shake, sort of akin to what a seizure looks like ! but i still experience them sometimes (20f) they're totally harmless, and tend to fade after a few seconds.   for physical therapy, just keep it fun ! i started to resent physical therapy as soon as it got boring, and i couldn't see the game in it anymore. (phys was so much more fun as a kid) a personal fitness trainer when she gets older is also an idea, also to make sure she doesn't overeat ! which can be an easy thing to do, when you don't exercise or move that much. horsebackriding did wonders for my balance, and swimming trains muscles you wouldn't normally due to lack of strength !   if your daughter seems to have the same shaking problems, i would suggest talking to a doctor about a selective dorsal rhizotomy ! i had it when i was five, and it made it so my legs didn't tense up near as much, and that they grew normally ! botox as a relaxing agent in the limbs also helps relax the muscles and keep the spasms and ""shrinking"" to a minimum. i've only tried it with my legs, but i think it'll work with arms too !   i am not mentally impaired in any way, but it being a disability to do to with the brains connection to the nervous system, it could happen. i would say treat her like a neuro-typical child until proven otherwise ! depending on the severity of cp, speaking can be difficult, so be patient !   my parents felt guilty at first, like it was their fault  we were born like this (my mom, especially) , but it's not the case. my life is different. not easy, but its mine. and if i could, i wouldn't change it. i wouldn't change a thing. my sister might, but she's also a bit more sensitive to the matter than i am. lean on your husband for strength, and please talk to eachother when things get difficult. there's nothing worse than knowing your parents are upset/stressed because you're ""extra trouble"". also, if she has any siblings, don't treat them differently, the eldest still needs just as much love as the little one.   when your daughter starts to realize she is different it can show in different ways, anxiety and depression being quite common in people with physical disabilities. i can't advocate for all disabled kids, but i liked knowing that my family was always there, and that they loved me for who i was, and not despite of my handicap. especially girls who need to feel pretty all the time can have it rough in the magazine and ""why doesn't anybody look like me"" years. be there for her, and love her like any other able bodied kid, and i promise she'll be the happiest kid around. (if she starts saying dangerous things when she gets older, contact a therapist immediately. self worth issues can also be a big deal and lead to some negative spirals. i've tried it, and survived. just be prepared!)   make sure not to keep her locked in the house, take her outside and travel ! see the world. doing what you want shouldn't be put on hold because of a disabled child. she'll love the adventure too !  i'd say be cautious of strangers, because some people tend to think children and young adults in wheelchairs can't take care of themselves or think. i've experienced where people have pat my head, or asked my mother how old i was, instead of speaking to me (and i use a manual wheelchair, i could imagine an electric won't do so well) try not to get upset, they don't mean it in a mean way. staring happens, but it's to be expected when something new catches someone's eyes. people can and will say the wrong thing. it happens cause they don't understand. (if it was a skiing accident is a common question... if you're really tired just say yes and move on. i sure have) if they say something hurtful, correct them nicely, and if your daughter wants to do so herself, even better !   i'm not going to sugar coat anything and say it'll be easy. it'll be an uphill battle, with a lot of bumps on the road. however, she'll be worth it every step of the way. i'm sure of it.

341125,"&gt;why is it wrong to terminate a pregnancy if a fetus is found to be malformed?  it's worth noting that this is a far less controversial position (or at least it implies a far less controversial position) than the claim which is the title of your cmv. i'll try to address both.  so first, it's not wrong to terminate a pregnancy if a fetus is found to be malformed, because it's not morally wrong to terminate any pregnancy for any reason. abortion is justified by a person's right to determine who can and cannot have access to their body, even if a life is at stake. what reason a person has for denying anyone else access to their body is irrelevant; the only thing that matters is that they wish to deny access. anyone claiming abortion is rendered morally impermissible when the reason for aborting is that the fetus is malformed is simply doing incompetent ethics, so the claim your question implies, that it is morally permissible to terminate a pregnancy if the fetus is malformed, is safe enough.  this claim, however, is not so safe:  &gt;i think it is morally reprehensible to bring a handicapped or physically/mentally deformed child into the world.  a corollary of this claim is that any person who discovers that the fetus they are incubating is malformed has a moral duty to abort that fetus. this is instantly problematic. first, it implies that the state might have some kind of right to force women to terminate certain pregnancies. second, it cuts directly across the grain of the principle that makes abortion morally permissible in the first place, which is the right to determine who can and cannot have access to your body; how can someone have the moral right to say ""yes, this person may have access to my body,"" yet be morally obligated to deny them access to their body? it's just schizophrenic.  third, and most importantly, your argument-from-burden fails to establish that carrying a malformed fetus to term is morally impermissible. i would agree that to saddle a person or group of people, or even a state which is merely the institutionalized will of a group of people, with a burden they did not consent to may be morally impermissible. thing is, the state, by which i mean we, have consented to that burden! that we provide state-funded care to non-normally functioning persons is proof enough that we've consented to the burden of providing care to non-normally functioning persons. simply saying ""they will be a burden"" is meaningless when we appear to have no problem with taking on that burden.  another problem; an implication of this view is that the life of a non-normally functioning person is not worth living, which is incredibly dehumanizing. to any currently-living non-normally functioning person this view says, ""your life is such a burden to both society *and* you that your mother had a moral *duty* to prevent you from being born."" although non-normally functioning people in many cases do require more care than normally functioning people, they are the only ones who can say whether or not their lives are worth living, as is the case with anybody.  one last problem; the argument-from-burden is a pretty slippery slope. you seem to want to say that we have a moral duty to terminate pregnancies where the fetus is, say, going to become a profoundly mentally or physically disabled person. but why stop there? why not fetuses that will become just moderately disabled people? why not fetuses that will become minimally disabled people? sure, the fetus with cerebral palsy will be a burden to society, but so will the blind person, deaf person, so will the person with a missing foot, the person with a high chance of developing diabetes or sickle-cell anemia. heck, people who are either shorter or taller than the normal height range of humans will be a burden since we will have to at least design safety features around their aberrant height! an argument-from-burden would say that to bring any pregnancy to term where the fetus will be non-normal in some way that represents a burden to society is morally impermissible, but clearly that fails a common-sense morality check in at least some of these cases.",1,,1

417022,"&gt;have you ever come across mechanics or systems that have made you frustrated because they‚Äôre not inclusive?   no, that would make me very silly.  first of all, it's important to understand that accessibility and inclusivity are not the same. accessibility is about *being able to play the game in the first place*, while inclusivity is about *whatever subjective judgements you make about the game's content*. one is(or, at least, *should be*) purely objective, the other is not.  secondly, lack of inclusivity is not inherently an iniquity, while its presence isn't inherently a virtue.   accessibility is a lot less muddy, it's generally best to make a game is accessible is possible, unless, of course it is to the detriment of your core audience.  now onto your example.  &gt;take dread as an example - the game relies on manual dexterity to play.  rpgs are, by their nature *incredibly accessible*. you can have motor control issues, you can have blindness, you can be quadriplegic, you can even be a blind quadriplegic and still play rpgs, as long as you have someone manage the character sheet/throw dice for you. or if you still retain some of your vision and mobility you could use a smartphone/pc to manage it yourself, roll your own dice! my friends aren't even disabled and i still help them out with their dice throws/char sheets because it lets them focus on rping. if you can understand/communicate with your group without causing major delays, you can play rpgs.  of course, it depends on what your definition of an rpg is. if an rpg for you is entirely about fucking around with dice and working on char sheets, then i can see how people can feel rpgs might not be inclusive to some groups as that would make *the helper* engage with the game and not the disabled person. however, if rpgs for you are roleplaying, decision-making and getting immersed in a fictional world, then you should have no problem seeing how offloading all the auxiliary stuff on a helper doesn't degrade the play experience much or at all.  so why exactly is lack of accessibility for people with fine motor control issues or,  you know, a lack of arms, a problem? the whole point of dread is, well *palpable dread*. it's a game that specifically uses a manual dexterity challenge that gets harder and harder to punctuate the rising tension and the doom of inevitable failure.   this means that players who can't partake in manual dexterity challenges will never be able to play dread, and that's completely fine. people without legs or with gross motor control issues will never feel the joy of squatting down with a barbell or the sensation of their lungs burning after a sprint. diabetic people will never taste hundreds of amazing foods for the fear of dying. people with epilepsy will never be dota pros. people in wheelchairs can't climb regular stairs and require specialized elevators. people with clinical depression struggle to feel any joy whatsoever and have trouble functioning on a day to day basis.  would you suggest we change squatting to accommodate for legless athletes? should we switch all industries to artificial sweeteners? should videogames remove all gfx that might potentially trigger a seizure? should we replace all stairs with elevators? should we lace all food and watter with antidepressants? of course you wouldn't and of course we won't do any of the above. so why does dread need to be changed to accommodate those physically unable to play it? you can make an alternative dread that can be played by people with motor control issues, but it will require changing the resolution mechanic so much that it will no longer be dread, because dread is defined by its unique resolution mechanic, it's not dnd where you can replace the dice with any random number generator and essentially have the same play experience. i'm not saying it will be an inferior copy, it might even be a better game, but it won't be the original.  **so, on the matter of accessibility: if a mechanic is in a game because it enhances the gameplay or the atmosphere, it should remain in the game even if it makes the game inaccessible to some people. if it serves no practical purpose, it can go.** in other words if a spell in the newest dnd splat requires the caster to drop down and give the gm 20, then it needs to go and it serves no practical purpose other than making the game harder for the disabled, the corpulent or the weak. however, if the same spell is in muscle wizards: door to liftopia and the entire game is based on roleplaying through physical exercise, then it serves both gameplay and thematic purposes, and if someone incapable of physical exercise attacks the game for lack of accessibility, they deserve to be laughed at. obviously this is a fairly subjective topic and it actually comes up a lot in this sub when discussing the need for social combat systems and skill checks in lieu of conversation in relation to the socially deprived or simply shy. this does, however, blur the line with inclusivity:  &gt;inclusivity in ttrpgs  my social groups are entirely(or nearly) non-existent in terms of ttrpg inclusivity and actively demonised everywhere else. as such when i see groups that get routine positive media attention and exist as a major part of the ttrpg community, i want to come over to them, slap them on the shoulder with a cheerful smile and say ""hahaha, *fuck you.* one is not entitled to being included in a fictional rpg world, nor are works pertaining to them entitled to financial success, but let me elaborate.  as a consumer, i support what i'm interested in playing. i have zero interest in playing tikor because the setting doesn't appeal to me in the slightest. i have zero interest in playing monsterhearts because neither the setting nor the system appeal to me in the slightest. if these products prosper then i am happy for the creators and those who enjoy such products, but if they don't, don't blame people who aren't interested in the product: blame the creator that in their quest for inclusivity they managed to exclude everybody else, i.e the ghostbusters (2016) fiasco.  as a creator, i create whatever i want to create and whatever i am capable of creating. if it means my work will be non-inclusive, then so be it, but i won't go out of the way to include topics that don't mesh with my creative vision, nor will i go out of the way to exclude topics that don't mesh with other people's sensibilities. and there is also the issue of tokenism, aka not doing inclusivity ""right"" and offending people anyway.  to put this differently: i feel like taking other people's work and then changing it for the sole purpose of making it more ""inclusive"" is both disgusting and dishonest unless done purely as a mental exercise. why? because what you are essentially doing is making a moral judgement of *your creative vision sucks and needs to be more inclusive*, while, at the same time, lacking confidence in your own creative vision to make a work of similar quality.  of course, there is a fine line here: there is absolutely nothing wrong with taking someone else's work and making a variation on it. however, while ""what if i took lord of the rings, but made the dominant culture inspired by african rather than european countries"" *might* produce the same result as ""i will make lotr more inclusive!""(in practice it doesn't, for a plethora of reasons, but let's ignore that for now), authorial intent absolutely matters here. both authors stand on the shoulders of giants, but while one is silently thankful to the giant for letting them stay on their shoulders while they grow,  the other is judging and attacking the giant while making use of their services. conveniently this is also the reason why so much derivative fiction created *specifically* to be inclusive is of poor quality: it's essentially a spite house of art: fuck you first, actual function/quality second(if at all a priority).",1,,2

532821,"it is unlikely to be possible under the theravada vinaya. below is the relevant discussion on disqualifications from ordination.   https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/section0054.html  &gt;applicants falling into the following categories should not be given the going-forth. as the going-forth is the customary first step in full acceptance, this means that they should not receive full acceptance, either. any bhikkhu who gives any of these applicants the going-forth incurs a dukka·π≠a. however, the applicant does count as having properly gone forth; if fully accepted he is properly accepted and need not be expelled. &gt; &gt;2) those with serious, disfiguring, or communicable diseases. the canon separates this category into three types: (a) a person afflicted with leprosy, boils, eczema, tuberculosis, or epilepsy. some have questioned whether this prohibition is compassionate to the diseased, but the origin story behind the rule shows that it was formulated out of compassion for the bhikkhus and lay supporters who would be burdened with the diseased person‚Äôs care. &gt; &gt;now at that time five diseases were widespread among the magadhans: leprosy, boils, eczema, tuberculosis, and epilepsy. people afflicted with the five diseases went to (the doctor) jƒ´vaka komƒÅrabhacca and said, ‚Äúit would be good, teacher, if you would treat us.‚Äù ‚Äúmasters, i have many duties. i am very busy. i have to tend to king bimbisƒÅra of magadha, as well as his harem and the community of bhikkhus headed by the buddha. i cannot treat you.‚Äù ‚Äúall our wealth will be yours, teacher, and we will be your slaves. it would be good, teacher, if you would treat us.‚Äù ‚Äúmasters, i have many duties. i am very busy. i have to tend to king bimbisƒÅra of magadha, as well as his harem and the community of bhikkhus headed by the buddha. i cannot treat you.‚Äù then it occurred to these people, ‚Äúthese sakyan-son monks are of pleasant virtue and conduct. having eaten fine meals, they lie down in beds sheltered from the wind (see¬†[pc¬†65](https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/section0022.html#pc65)). what if we were to go forth among the sakyan-son monks? there the bhikkhus would tend to us and jƒ´vaka komƒÅrabhacca would treat us.‚Äù so, going to the bhikkhus, they requested the going-forth. the bhikkhus gave them the going-forth, they gave them the full acceptance. the bhikkhus tended to them and jƒ´vaka komƒÅrabhacca treated them. now at that time the bhikkhus‚Äîtending to many sick bhikkhus‚Äîwere continually begging, continually hinting, ‚Äúgive a meal for the sick. give a meal for those tending to the sick. give medicine for the sick.‚Äù jƒ´vaka komƒÅrabhacca‚Äîtending to many sick bhikkhus‚Äîneglected one of his duties to the king. then a certain man afflicted with the five diseases went to jƒ´vaka komƒÅrabhacca ‚Ä¶ (as above). then it occurred to him, ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ what if i were to go forth among the sakyan-son monks? there the bhikkhus would tend to me and jƒ´vaka komƒÅrabhacca would treat me. when i am well i will disrobe.‚Äù so, going to the bhikkhus, he requested the going-forth. the bhikkhus gave him the going-forth; they gave him the full acceptance. the bhikkhus tended to him and jƒ´vaka komƒÅrabhacca treated him. when he was well he disrobed. then jƒ´vaka komƒÅrabhacca saw the man disrobed. on seeing him, he addressed him, ‚Äúmaster, weren‚Äôt you gone forth among the bhikkhus?‚Äù ‚Äúyes, teacher.‚Äù ‚Äúbut why did you act in this way?‚Äù then the man told the matter to jƒ´vaka komƒÅrabhacca. jƒ´vaka komƒÅrabhacca criticized and complained and spread it about, ‚Äúhow can the revered ones give the going-forth to a person afflicted with the five diseases?‚Äù ‚Äî[mv.i.39.1-6](https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/mv/mvi.html#pts39_1) &gt; &gt;four of these diseases are explained in the commentaries.¬†leprosy¬†includes scabies, yaws, and psoriasis as well. apparently, any other disease that causes ulcerating lesions on the skin would also come under this heading. if the disease occurs in small patches the size of the back of a nail in areas covered when fully robed and is in a condition that won‚Äôt spread further, the applicant may go forth. if the patches are visible on the face or the backs of hands, then even if they are small and won‚Äôt spread, he shouldn‚Äôt go forth. if he has been treated so that the patches disappear completely, he may. the sub-commentary adds here that the ‚Äúback of the nail‚Äù means the back of the nail of the small finger or toe; if the patches are small and in a covered area but still spreading, the applicant should not go forth. boils,¬†according to the commentary, also covers skin excrescencies looking like fingers or cow nipples. if the boils are not spreading, no larger than jujube pits (the same size as olive pits), and in an area covered when fully robed, the applicant may go forth; if they are in an uncovered area, he shouldn‚Äôt. acne and warts don‚Äôt count as boils under this rule. eczema¬†covers a wide variety of skin diseases, differing from those included under ‚Äúleprosy‚Äù in that they are not debilitating and do not ulcerate or ooze. thus ringworm and athlete‚Äôs foot would come under this category. as under the preceding category, small, non-spreading infestations in an area covered when fully robed would be allowable. epilepsy¬†includes both grand and petit mal, as well as cases of seizures caused by hostile spirit possession (!). (b) a person with goiter. this was apparently incurable at the time. at present, if such a person is cured, he may go forth. (c) a person afflicted with an ‚Äúevil‚Äù disease. this, the commentary says, includes such things as hemorrhoids, fistulas, upsets of bile or phlegm, cough, asthma, or any disease that is ‚Äúchronically afflicting (reading¬†niccƒÅtura¬†with the thai edition of the commentary), exceedingly painful, disgusting, and disagreeable.‚Äù aids and cancer would come under here. &gt; &gt;5) those who are physically handicapped, feeble, or deformed. the following list is from the canon, with passages from the commentary in brackets: an applicant with a hand cut off [c: at least from the palm] ‚Ä¶ a foot cut off [c: at least from the ball of the foot].. a hand and foot cut off ‚Ä¶ an ear cut off ‚Ä¶ a nose cut off ‚Ä¶ an ear and nose cut off [c: in the case of ears and nose, if the cut-off part can be reconnected, the applicant may go forth] ‚Ä¶ a finger or toe cut off [c: so that nothing of the nail appears] ‚Ä¶ a thumb or big toe cut off .. a cut tendon ‚Ä¶ one who has webbed fingers [c: if the fingers are separated by surgery, or if a sixth finger is removed, the applicant may go forth] ‚Ä¶ a bent-over person [c: bent-over forward (a hunchback), bent-over back (a swayback), bent-over to either side; a slight crookedness is to be expected in all candidates, as only a buddha is perfectly straight] ‚Ä¶ a dwarf ‚Ä¶ one with a club foot (or elephantiasis) [c: if the foot is operated on so as to become a normal foot, he may go forth] ‚Ä¶ one who disgraces the assembly [c: through some deformity; (the list here is very long and includes many seemingly harmless characteristics, such as connected eyebrows, a lack of a beard or moustache, etc. this is one area where the commentary seems to have gone overboard)] ‚Ä¶ one who is blind in one eye ‚Ä¶ one who has a crooked limb [c:¬†limb¬†= at least a hand, foot, or finger] ‚Ä¶ one who is lame ‚Ä¶ one half-paralyzed [c: paralyzed in one hand, one foot, or down one side] ‚Ä¶ a cripple [c: one who needs a crutch or stool to move along] ‚Ä¶ one feeble from old age ‚Ä¶ one who is blind‚Ä¶ dumb [c: unable to speak or with such a bad stutter that he cannot pronounce the three refuges clearly]‚Ä¶ deaf ‚Ä¶ blind and dumb ‚Ä¶ blind and deaf (¬ß‚Äînot mentioned in bd) ‚Ä¶ deaf and dumb ‚Ä¶ blind and deaf and dumb. again, some people have questioned the compassion behind these prohibitions, but the point of the prohibitions is to keep the bhikkhus from being burdened with looking after those who are a burden or an embarrassment to their families. there is at least one case in the canon of a dwarf who ordained and became an arahant (ud.vii.1-2), but apparently he, like a·πÖgulimƒÅla, was accepted into the community by the buddha himself. if it so happens that a bhikkhu develops any of these handicaps after his ordination‚Äîe.g., he goes blind or loses a limb‚Äîhe need not disrobe, and his fellow bhikkhus are duty-bound to care for him (see¬†[chapter¬†5](https://www.dhammatalks.org/vinaya/bmc/section0044.html#bmc2chapter5)).",1,,0

175065,"i think you need to reconsider the idea that laws are always equally applicable, and consider the significance of psychology in the human experience. take my paraplegic. they are given special legal allowances, like being able to park in handicap bays, to help mitigate the disadvantages of being physically disabled. in most developed countries, there are laws that mandate lifts and ramps to improve handicap accessibility. if we were using one universal law, none of these conveniences would exist. the paraplegic would legally have the same access to stairs as an able bodied person, but such access is meaningless, because they are incapable of actually taking advantage of the facilities.  similarly if we were going to argue that there should be one law on marriage that is equally applicable, we could argue that marriage is defined as being between a man and a woman, and everyone has a right to marriage. obviously gay people would have the same rights and laws applied as everyone else, but these laws would be of no use to them, because they are gay, and have no desire to marry a woman. gay marriage laws in this context would provide special consideration for gay people. i think this qualifies as an example of special treatment because of their thoughts. gay people have a very strong preference for the same sex. it is not something they can change about themselves, but it is a preference, not a physical impairment.  now you could argue that religious belief is not as entrenched as sexuality, psychologically speaking, and i'd be inclined to agree. none the less, belief in god, is fundamental to the worldview of religious people, and it's not simply a thought. for these people, their behavior is predicated on this worldview. to not behave according to their god would be to defy everything they believe to be true. that is not something that people can do easily, if at all. it would be like me telling you to believe in a god. you can entertain the idea, but it won't have any meaning for you. assuming you're an atheist, you cannot simply make yourself believe that god exists. that sort of belief requires revelation.   my point is that religious behaviour, and other deeply entrenched beliefs are in many ways like a physical disability, or a sexual preference. it is something essential about a person that cannot easily be changed, and to expect people to go against their beliefs - and the behavioural implications of such beliefs - is in principle wrong, and a liberal state shouldn't make such an expectation.   obviously we can't let people ignore laws entirely, especially if those laws are necessary for the safety of the rest of the populous, so full religious freedom isn't possible. still, if making allowances for religion is at all possible, and won't drastically change the way society functions, i see no reason not to do so. it is about respecting the beliefs of others, and accommodating them wherever possible.  to take a non religious example. suppose someone who eats meat invites a vegetarian over for dinner. the meateater eats meat every day for dinner, and if we were to take an opinion like yours, it would be fair for the meateater to expect the vegetarian to eat meat, because they are guests of a different culture with different ideas of what dinner is. still, i would argue that the right thing to do for the meat eater is to forego meat, and prepare a vegetarian meal, because it is showing respect for the beliefs of others. however, if the situation were reversed, i think the meat eater should not expect meat, because they are perfectly happy eating vegetarian food, but the vegetarian is not happy preparing meat. though this is a double standard, it is fair, because in both situations, both parties are happy to eat the food available, and the beliefs of both have been respected. now this isn't exactly about low, more social convention. still, they are two sides of the same coin, and it illustrates the point i'm trying to make.  it is almost always appropriate to treat people differently, if doing so does not cost much, and does help to facilitate and respect the beliefs of others.  to answer your last question. assuming you were born in the country you live in, most laws probably are already tailored to accommodate your cultural beliefs.",1,,0

165735,"oh my sweet summer child.  short answer: probably not.  longer answer: i mean, we might be able to tamper with genetics enough but we wouldn't want to.  detailed explanation...  evolution favors diversity. if you breed humans for a selective end, even if it seems like an obvious benefit, you hurt human ability to adapt in the future. think of the shih tzu. this snub nosed runt has been bread so far apart from most dogs that its existence is dependent on humans. its breeding is now too extreme and it would be incapable of survival if humans went away. now, obviously, in your question we wouldn't tamper with humans to this extreme, but we would still be making humans a weaker species and one less equipped to meet a wide diversity of challenges.   when it comes to physically/mentally disabled, blind, susceptible to disease you ignore one big thing... that shit still happens in nature. in environments where it's still expected for your cause of death to be being eaten, deaf, dumb, blind and gimpy critters are still born. you don't usually see them because, nature. these physical problems are mutations. they might not manifest right away, and they might not even become physical problems until the environment changes. disease is separate from the general biological functionality. you cant breed out fetal alcohol syndrome, at best you could breed out pleasure from alcohol, but that in and of itself could have bad consequences.   a good example of this the genetic predisposition for some disease. when all we had was nuts and berries, a subtle mutation which would make diabetes more likely didn't really pose a positive or negative until there was enough food for it to be a problem. inversely, leprosy has all but been eliminated because it's almost killed everybody who's susceptible to the disease. other problems, like macular degeneration, dependency on vitamins and aging are simply consequence of living and won't likely go away with heavy genetic modification.  humans breeds would make for an interesting experiment. many people already falsely equate race to breeds but there simply isn't enough diversity for this to be equivocal. full human breeding on this scale would look more like eloi and morlocks; the end product would take a long ass time and result in something only adapted to specific living conditions. ultimately though, even if we ignore ethics/morality, there's a huge ""why would we do this?"" we could spend less and do more mapping human genetics and simulating multiple generations of change with a well designed computer model. best yet, we wouldn't have to feed it.",1,,0

895131,"i think the issue with the definition of ""able"" you gave is you left out the *ability* aspect of it. obviously difference does not inherently mean disability, no one has ever claimed it has. can the majority of people do something that you cannot do, or can the majority of people do something far more easily than you can, and to what extent does this discrepancy impact your life, health, or ability to function in society? what is the cause of this difference, and is it temporary or permanent? these are the questions that bring us closer to a realistic definition.  i think ultimately, those in your camp and those in mine want the same thing--we are trying to love and appreciate ourselves more, and find happiness and acceptance for ourselves. for someone like you, it seems that calling adhd a disability and focusing on the negative aspects makes it feel like people are trying to tell you that you are incapable of certain things or you are broken, and you feel that this negativity will only discourage you and make it harder to succeed. maybe it even feels invalidating to your success.   whereas someone like me would feel that highlighting all the ways that adhd has led to us doing things that hurt our health, relationships, education, job, etc. that we previously did not understand why we were doing or why we couldn't be better, has been freeing. we can free ourselves of the notion that it is our fault, a moral failing, that we are lazy or stupid or incompetent. we can be empowered by understanding how our brains work differently, and use that knowledge to build more robust strategies. to someone who feels this way, calling adhd a superpower or insisting it is not a disability feels invalidating of the many aspects or our life that have suffered for years because of it, and it threatens the knowledge that gave us the confidence to stop blaming ourselves for something we cannot control.  in other words, the first group translates positivity about the disorder into positivity about who they are, whereas the second translates negativity about the disorder into positivity about who they are in spite of the challenges they have faced. ultimately, both just trying to find self-love.  please feel free to tell me if i have mischaracterized your stance.  &gt;it ‚Äòfeels‚Äô as though you are disabled. but in all reality you are not.  i also just want to say, with no malice intended, that statements like this may be why your comments are garnering some hostility. it comes across like you feel there is a completely objective definition of disability and everyone else is objectively wrong. and it also sounds like you are saying ""you can do it if you just believe in yourself, or just try harder,"" which id a sentiment many of us have heard our whole lives, and minimizes our struggle. that may not even be how you actually mean it (again, i am only saying this is how it comes across), but there are no objective definitions for 'disability'--that's why we are able to have this discussion to begin with.   personally i view disability itself as a spectrum to some degree. there are plenty of things where someone has a lack or lesser ability compared to others, but either the amount it impairs function in society is minimal or has become minimal due to low-effort accommodations, and thus society doesn't consider it a disability.  consider eyesight:   some people are colorblind. they lack the ability to see certain colors, or you could say they see colors differently than everyone else. this does affect them in some ways--contexts where things are color-coded, they cannot participate as easily as others. but for most situations our society has been able to accomodate for this--for example stop signs having a distinct shape and word in addition to color. so most people would not consider colorblindness a disability.  similarly, most people with worse than 20/20 vision wouldn't be considered disabled, because glasses allow them to level the playing field in a relatively low-effort way. sure, still an added inconvenience that others don't have, still an additional cost, but overall it is not a majorly debilitating issue.  but as you get to more extreme cases of poor vision, you see more significant impact and struggle. for some people, glasses or other corrective measures do not work or barely help. for someone who cannot drive, read signs in public, etc. because of their vision, despite tools like glasses, it becomes more into disability territory. for example you can be ""legally blind"" while still having some sight, just very very poor sight. and then of course there are people who are fully blind, who require even more accommodations and have even more limitations despite those accommodations.  i think adhd can be viewed on a similar spectrum. for some people who can function with the disorder without major inconvenience or difficulty, or reasonable accomodations are readily available and bridge the gap, you probably wouldn't call that a disability. but on the other extreme, the person who cannot drive because they keep crashing their car; cannot maintain relationships because they cannot control their emotions; cannot hold down a job because of tardiness, forgetfulness, distraction, etc.; has major financial issues due to impulsive spending, forgetting to pay bills on time, losing their job; has major health issues now due to neglecting their hygiene, abusing substances to cope, overeating to the point of obesity or neglecting their nutritional needs to the point of deficiency, injured themselves often because of impulsive behavior; and many other major, impactful issues, i would say has more than enough impediments to count as a disability.   the question really just becomes at what exact point does it cross over officially into disability territory, and personally... i'm not sure that even matters. even the highest-functioning, most mild cases have some type of accommodation to help them, even if they don't know it. and personally i feel you don't really need to have a disability‚Ñ¢Ô∏è to get accommodations in settings like work. if a certain accommodation makes you more productive and is reasonable, it's worth doing regardless of how impaired you are overall.  so i feel like, if you view your own case as counting as a disability and want to take steps to accomodate it to function better, great. if you feel your case doesn't warrent that label, great. you know your own experience best. i don't see why both parties cannot be right here. and importantly, there is no need to police others on this--the first person should not insist the second person has a disability, and the second shouldn't insist the first doesn't. just as a run of the mill glasses-wearer doesn't have a right to insist the legally blind person isn't disabled if they feel they are, or even a fully blind person has no right to insist the legally blind person isn't disabled. no need to impose our perspectives of our own disorders onto others.  having an official label as a disability brings value in terms of legitimizing and normalizing accommodations that make our lives easier. i see this as a positive change. many deaf people do not consider their deafness a disability, yet still benefit from legal protections that consider it as such.   sorry for the essay--i just thought it was a topic that warranted a more in-depth response.",1,,1

157804,"and you still can play a vampire with mental illness.  that hasn't been taken from you.  but lets also examine what you're saying.  there is a clan of ""physical disability"" - the nosferatu.  but did they give the nosferatu ""human disabilities""?  do you have to pick whether you're blind/deaf/paraplegic on making a nosferatu?  no.  and why is that?  why do they avoid that?   because nosferatu are based on the movie *nosferatu* of course.  they're hideous monsters, because the movie nosferatu are hideous monsters.  and that's what the clans are.  each of them are some form of monster - brujah the angry, rebellious, smash your face in monster, gangrel the beast hunting you in the woods, nosferatu the hideous monster who appears from nowhere, toreador the refined seductive monster, ventrue the rich, lordly ""do my will"" monster, and so on and so forth.  the clans, especially the original camarilla clans, all represent various flavors of classic villain and vampire archtypes.    where does malkavian fit in?  they're the crazy monsters.  the ones who are nuts, the loonies, the crazy.  and to be that they need to be able to be over-the-top horror movie crazy.  actually believe they're a confederate general in the civil war.  see everything through a lens of science and perform hideous experiments.  seers with supernatural insight, driven insane by their visions.  serial killers who see reality through a funhouse mirror, but might have understanding beyond you.    tying this to ""mental illness"" fails on multiple levels, the same way tying nosferatu to physical disabilities would fail.  mentally ill people don't have ""crazy person insight"" or anything of the sort.  they're just people.  they don't mysteriously find some way to tie the modern city of baltimore to the civil war so they can live and function while seeing everyone as if it was 1860 - if they're that detached from reality they're incapable of functioning in the real world.   people who experiment on humans are nasty, despicable pieces of shit, not cackling evil in lab coats who festoon their lab with lightning rods.    so yeah, if you want to play a mentally ill vampire, play a mentally ill vampire.  if you want to play a physically disabled vampire, play a physically disabled vampire.  if you want to play a malkavian, play a malkavian.  if you want to play a nosferatu play a nosferatu.  don't make one be the other, because the game is better when the malkavians can have the twisted insight, the insane logic, the skewed version of reality that's occasionally more true than our normal one, and the nosferatu are hideous twisted monstrosities that can't be mistaken for human if they come out in the light.",1,,1
795921,"the text below is from ""expanded universe"" by robert a heinlein and is a re-vamping of testimony he gave before congress on 19 june 1979.  the formatting is likely a little busted but it ought to be understandable.  it was too big for one reply so i replied to myself twice to maintain the order of the passages.   &gt; honorable chairman, ladies, and gentlemen- ""happy new year! &gt;  &gt; indeed a happy new year beginning the 11th year in the age of space, greatest era of our race-the greatest!-despite gasoline shortages, pollution, overpopulation, inflation, wars and threats of war. 'these too shall pass'-but the stars abide. &gt;  &gt; our race will spread out through space-unlimited room, unlimited energy, unlimited wealth. this is certain. &gt;  &gt; but i am not certain that the working language will be english. the people of the united states seem to have suffered a loss of nerve. however, i am limited by the call to a discussion of 'spinoffs' from our space program useful to the aged and the handicapped. &gt;  &gt; in all scientific research, the researcher may or may not find what he is looking for-indeed, his hypothesis may be demolished-but he is certain to learn something new. . . which may be and often is more important than what he had hoped to learn. &gt;  &gt; this is the principle of serendipity. it is so invariant that it can be considered an empirically established natural law. &gt;  &gt; in space research we always try to do more with less, because today the pay load is tightly limited in size and in weight. this means endless research and development to make everything smaller, lighter, foolproof, and fail-proof. it works out that almost everything developed for space can be used in therapy and thereby benefits both the elderly and the handicapped, the two groups requiring the most therapy of all sorts. &gt;  &gt; when you reach old age-say 70 and up-it approaches certainty that you will be in some way handicapped. not necessarily a wheelchair or crutches or a white cane-most handicaps do not show. so all of us are customers for space spinoffs-if not today, then soon. &gt;  &gt; witness holds up nasa brochure. &gt;  &gt; there is no need for me to discuss applications that nasa has already described. but this i must say: nasa's presentation is extremely modest; it cites only 46 applications- whereas there are hundreds. often one bit of research results in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generations; each generation usually has multiple applications-spinoffs have spinoffs, branching out like a tree. to get a feeling for this, think of the endless applications of lee deforest's vacuum tube, dr. shockley's transistor. &gt;  &gt; here is a way to spot space-research spinoffs: if it involves microminiaturization of any sort, minicomputers, miniaturized long-life power sources, highly reliable microswitches, remotely-controlled manipulators, image enhancers, small and sophisticated robotics or cybernetics, then, no matter where you find the item, at a critical point in its development it was part of our space program. &gt;  &gt; examples: &gt;  &gt; image enhancer: this magic gadget runs an x-ray or fluoroscope picture through a special computer, does things to it, then puts it back onto the screen. or stores it for replay. or both. it can sharpen the contrast, take out 'noise,' remove part of the picture that gets in the way of what you need to see, and do other wizard-of-oz stunts. &gt;  &gt; this is the wonder toy that took extremely weak digital code signals and turned them into those beautiful, sharp, true-color photographs from the surface of mars in the viking program and also brought us the voyager photographs of jupiter and its moons. &gt;  &gt; i first saw one in 1977 at the medical school of the university of arizona-saw them put a long catheter up through a dog's body in order to inject an x-rayopaque dye into its brain. this does not hurt the dog. more about this later- ""i did not know what an image enhancer was until i saw one demonstrated and did not learn until this year that it came from our space program. possibly the doctor did not know. m.d.'s can use instruments with	no notion that they derive from space research and a patient usually knows as little about it as did that dog. &gt;  &gt; the most ironical thing about our space program is that there are thousands of people alive today who would be dead were it not for some item derived from space research-but are blissfully unaware of the fact-and complain about 'wasting all that money on stupid, useless space stunts when we have so many really important problems to solve right here on earth.' &gt;  &gt; '-all that money-'! &gt;  &gt; that sort of thinking would have kept columbus at home. &gt;  &gt; nasa's annual budget wouldn't carry h.e.w. ten days. the entire 10 years of the moon program works out to slightly less than five cents per citizen per day. &gt;  &gt; would you like to be a wheelchair case caught by a hurricane such as that one that failed to swing east and instead hit the texas and louisiana coast? that storm was tracked by weather satellite; there was ample warning for anyone who would heed it-plenty of time to evacuate not only wheelchair cases but bed patients. &gt;  &gt; a similar storm hit bangladesh a while back; it too was tracked by satellite. but bangladesh lacks means to warn its people; many thousands were killed. here in the united states it would take real effort to miss a hurricane warning; even houses with no plumbing have television. &gt;  &gt; weather satellites are not spinoff; they are space program. but they must be listed because bad weather of any sort is much rougher on the aged and the handicapped than it is on the young and able-bodied. &gt;  &gt; portable kidney machine: if a person's kidneys fail, he must 'go on the machine' or die. 'the machine' is a fate so grim that the suicide rate is high. miniaturization has made it possible to build portable kidney machines. this not only lets the patient lead a fairly normal life, travel and so forth, but also his blood is cleaned steadily as with a normal kidney; he is no longer cumulatively poisoned by his own toxins between his assigned days or nights 'on the machine.' &gt;  &gt; this is new. a few have already made the switch but all kidney victims can expect it soon. the suicide rate has dropped markedly-life is again worth living; hope has been restored. &gt;  &gt; computerized-a,cial tomography, or cat, or 'brain scan': they strap you to a table, fasten your skull firmly, duck behind a barrier, and punch a button- then an automatic x-ray machine takes endless pictures, a tiny slice at a time. a special computer synthesizes each series of slices into a picture; a couple of dozen such pictures show the brain in three-dimensional, fine detail, a layer at a time. &gt;  &gt; doppler ultrasound stethoscope: another microminiaturization spinoff. this instrument is to an ordinary stethoscope as a rolls royce is to a model-t ford."" &gt;  &gt; witness stands up, turns from side to side. ""look at me, please! i'll never be mr. america; i'll never take part in the olympics. i've climbed my last mountain. &gt;  &gt; but i'm here, i'm alive, i'm functioning. &gt;  &gt; fourteen months ago my brain was dull-normal and getting worse, slipping toward 'human vegetable.' i slept 16 hours a day and wasn't worth a hoot the other 8 hours. &gt;  &gt; were it not for the skill of dr. norman chater, plus certain spinoffs from the space program, today i would either be a human vegetable or, if lucky, dead of cerebral stroke. &gt;  &gt; my father was not lucky; from a similar disorder it took him years to die-miserable years. he died before the operation that saved me had been invented, long before there was medical spinoff from space technology. &gt;  &gt; am i elderly? i'm 72. i suffered from a disorder typical of old age, almost never found in the young. &gt;  &gt; am i handicapped? yes, but my handicaps do not interfere with my work-or my joy in life. over forty years ago the navy handed me a piece of paper that pronounced me totally and permanently disabled. i never believed it. that piece of paper wore out; i did not. &gt;  &gt; mrs. heinlein and i spent 1976 and -77 on blood drives all over this nation. we crisscrossed the country so many times we lost track. it was worthwhile; we recruited several thousand new blood donors-but it was very strenuous. by the end of '77 we badly needed a rest, so we took a sea voyage. she and i were walking the beach on moorea, tahiti, when i turned my head to look at a mountain peak-and something happened. &gt;  &gt; i balanced on my left leg and said, 'darling, i'm terribly sorry but i think i've had a stroke. something happened inside my head and now i'm seeing double and my right side feels paralyzed.' &gt;  &gt; mrs. heinlein half carried me, half dragged me, back to the landing-got me back aboard. &gt;",1,,1

600818,"*fo' shizzle, ma tardizzle!*  though i wonder if those advocating against the use of hurtful language, and the insensitive general public are locked in a linguistic arms-race.   ""blind"" and ""deaf"" are not inherently offensive: they're simply neutral descriptors of conditions. but pc would have us believe we must use the terms ""visually impaired"" and ""hearing impaired"", as if they are more sensitive or precise.   i don't think people will *ever* see blindness or deafness as desirable conditions, and it's likely that we'll see complete technological solutions before the end of the century. to be blind or deaf is not to be a bad person, nor should they be viewed that way. but they have a disability that most people would not want to have, and so *the conditions themselves* have a negative connotation.   yet instead of focussing on helping people accept those with disabilities as being social equals and capable of leading rewarding lives, their attention is diverted to the *words*; and if they can get people to change the words they use, then the new label will supposedly be free of negative connotations, when it's the condition itself people have negative feelings for.  just as with the shift from colored, to negro, to black, to african-american. these terms are largely neutral, but gain negative connotation *because people are racist towards blacks.* it's the racism that needs addressing, more than changing the terminology people use.",1,,-1

928119,"my sister's deaf and pretty into deaf culture, and this is how i'd break down the whole ""disability"" thing. in a lot of ways, it's similar to how some people want to be called differently-abled instead of handicapped or visually impaired instead of blind.  yeah, you may not buy into that pc crap, but this is important to people who have to live with this every day, so who are you to give a shit anyway?  it's about dignity and independence and not having people tell them how to live, and you have to respect that.  deaf people also have a strong culture with it's own language and they want to preserve and legitimize that culture, so they don't like the muggles interfering. they do have a way of making this all seem really fundamentalist like pistolwhip's friend, but there's a long history there that you're not really going to learn about on a post on reddit. at the same time, deaf people want and need accommodation to function in a hearing world, just like differently-abled people need bigger bathrooms and visually impaired people need beeping pedestrian crossings.   as far as the implants are concerned, what you have to realize is they're not a cure.  here's some of the issues:  first and most importantly, the sound fidelity isn't anywhere near that of a hearing person.  a child can learn to hear speech and hear things like footsteps, but they'll never be able to tune an instrument or differentiate two similar sounding voices and talking on the telephone is notoriously difficult. formerly hearing people who have had them say that it's a very tinny, digital sound, not anywhere close to natural hearing. second, people with them will always be different and immediately recognized as so. children will point to the wires coming out of their head and potential bosses will worry that it'll affect their work and people walking down the street will feel sorry for them and the tsa will always give them a hard time. third, most kids that get them are never exposed to deaf culture or even other deaf kids, and i, for one, think that's a shame. fourth, the implants are a pain in the ass. there's the initial surgery itself and then there's all kinds of therapy for years after and a lifetime of maintenance and replacement surgeries and equipment issues, etc.   so, yeah some people just don't see the point of having the implants done. it's not a cure, like a corneal implant to a blind person, one surgery and you're reading novels and admiring a picasso. it's more like getting someone who's in a wheelchair to use crutches. yeah, they won't have to worry about elevators or ramps or chair lifts and they'll have a better idea of what it's like to be ""normal,"" but they're still disabled and getting around is still a pain in the ass and it's a lot of friggin work to be able to use those crutches. it's not as if they'll ever run a marathon or go out dancing or play tag with their children.",1,,1

966228,"i'm a congenital amputee(i was born without legs.  technically it's a complicated series of birth defects, but it all adds up to 'missing legs' so i'm basically an amputee.)   being handicapped is not one solid disadvantage.  sure, it makes a lot of basic ambulation difficult, and on the *whole* it probably makes life harder, but there are all sorts of things i can do because i'm handicapped that able-bodied people can't do.  i have probably two thirds of my college payed for between government assistance and my wheelchair basketball scholarship.  i can relate to the hurt and broken people of the world more easily than i ever could have if i was able-bodied, and i can inspire people by just living my life.  i get people coming up to me and telling me how much i inspire them, when all i am doing is going to class.  it's a little annoying, yeah, but it's undeniably powerful.   i'd be lying if i said i've never been through a 'why me, god?' phase.  for a long stretch of my life, i thought of myself as broken, freakish or worthless. it was rough and brutal, and i hated myself. i lost my faith entirely for a while, stopped thinking of myself as a christian.  then when i regained my faith, it was like a million demons that had been whispering lies about my disability in my ear got exorcised at once.     i realized that [jeremiah 29:11] applied to me, too.  i realized that just because i didn't have legs, didn't mean squat.  that god was going to utilize me in a powerful way, lower limbs or no.  that was when i started looking at my life and realized i had opportunities and abilities that no one else did.   so, why doesn't god heal amputees?  because he is going to use them to show his glory all the more powerfully because of their lack of limbs.    there's a basis for this in scripture too.  john 9:2-3(nlt) says  &gt;and his disciples asked him, ""rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?"" jesus answered, ""it was neither that this man sinned, nor his parents; but it was so that the works of god might be displayed in him.  some people take that to mean nothing more than that god's works *can* be shown through a disabled person.  i take it to mean that it allows people to show god's glory *better*.  take the example of me inspiring people.  i would not be inspirational in the slightest if i was able bodied.  i know this because my sister is basically female me without the disability.  she is 6'3"", 180 pounds with an incredibly athletic build.  she is extremely smart,  and just is generally gifted across the board.  she is the least inspiring person i can think of.     it inspires no one for people with all the advantages to tell them they can succeed.  but when someone who is handicapped tells them that, they believe it.     so i would say that is why god doesn't heal amputees.  them being an amputee might be a key part of god's plan for them.  i know god's plan for me includes my disability, and i know that i can serve him more powerfully than i ever could have without it.     hope i helped!",1,,2

(lmboooo)     that last sentence about cutesy labels ""blinding"" nondisabled people (!? now idk how i feel about that word!) sinks in the value in seeing the reality of our lives!! ....whether that means seeing how ugly and brutal and bloodchoked/debilitated someone's illness is, or how deeply in need of assistance we are ... or how autonomous and capable and vibrantly disabled someone else's life is!      this is always (lately...as i've been getting to know a more diverse community of disabled folks!) a kind of tender spot with me (and many #pwme or people with myalgic encephalomyelitis or #me/cfs), bc.... this, the main disease that disables me??      is nowhere near as forgiving! to enable all that traveling and ...adulting and such! lol      i've only been able to shower (properly, even using my bench) a couple of times since summer.   i've only escaped my home a few times when someone came to roll me around outside (or i had a cab picking me up outside my door for a doc appt)--and even those excursions required days of it being way harder to feed myself.      it's very hard to admit these things--especially as someone who looks young and healthy. but this disease is debiltating affff ...      and  is now \~ the most common disability (triggered by covid and most commonly labeled ""long covid"" if it even gets labeled that specifically!)!!      until you get so advanced/sick as i now am, that i am usually grossly unshowered and can barely walk more than a few feet without my eyeballs crossing conspicuously in my face, and slurring my words/thoughts, and walking like a drunkard on a very good day?! lol ... only being able to keep my wits about me if i assiduously commit to being a full-time bed monster!?  lolol   me/long covid is also (usually) \*\*entirely invisible\*\* and misunderstood so \~evvvveryone \*assumes\* pretty much the opposite of what you are describing!!     they assume you are pitiful and incapable and tragic... when the reality is you need a little assistance and physical accommodations for a wheelchair but you're fine! lol   with us, they assume we can do things and are just ""lazy"" or ""depressed"" or ""anxious"" or not determined enough--not that we're being sucked in from the inside by our cellular metabolism in an inconspicuously violent and totally unrelenting disease process...--so...even people who'd be very kind to someone undergoing cancer or ra or ms or aids (all diseases with higher qol ratings /less disability on average than me!!) ??

are generally more disabled than folks who are paralyzed in a relatively stable/uncomplicated way, and otherwise healthy!       \[and i pause at that bc i think that is a mindfuck for healthy folks especially but .... for both ""camps"" of disabled folks i've hypothetically referenced here). almost everyone has a lot to process and learn from that re: the nature of disability--and judging our ""books"" /bodies by their covers!     and secondly: that bar, the idea disabled folks are ""just different and can still do everything""?! it can easily kill many of us--especially the most prevalent (and disabling) disability that has exploded with the pandemic.    so there's a ""understand long covid and potentially save a life/some lives of someone you care about!"" aspect here but mainly as a disability advocate!?

269956,"**a complete end to human freedom**  although the previously outlined scenario is obviously far out into the realm of science fiction, it serves as the only logical response to the science-fiction scenario's proposed by proponents of technology who see technology as life's only chance to escape the destruction of our planet.  it would be more relevant to look into our direct future, as an end to our freedom isn't an expectation far out in the future, but something to be feared in our immediate present.  but first, we have to look at what freedom means. freedom is not the same as material wealth, or physical health. a person can have all material wealth that he could desire and live a healthy life, without being free. freedom refers to a condition of life in which humans are not dependent for their necessities on other individual human beings or large organizations, without any such reciprocal dependence on the individual.  as an example, it is true that most women are dependent upon men. however, a reciprocal dependence generally exists, in which men are dependent upon tasks carried out by women. hence, such dependence isn't a type of dependence that severely impacts our freedom. there are exceptions, societies in which women are completely dependent upon women, but in general, men's power over women is balanced by women's power over men. even if a women is completely dependent upon her physical beauty (an obviously undesirable situation), this still leaves women with reciprocal power over men.  similarly, it is true that i can be dependent upon a trader who visits my village to provide me with salt or some other simple products that my local village does not produce itself. however, at a low level of organization, the trader is dependent upon me and my village as well. if the trader had somehow slighted me, my family would join me in no longer consuming resources from this trader, and hence the trader has at least some reciprocal dependence upon us.  in our modern day situation, such reciprocal dependence has largely disappeared from human relations. as an example, a boss is increasingly less dependent upon his individual employers. for every employee that refuses to be exploited, dozens of others can rapidly be hired who would be very willing to carry out whatever task the previous employee saw as a form of exploitation.  it is true that labor laws can be created that prevent such exploitation. however, this does not provide any freedom at all, as the individual has very little say in regards to what the law will outlaw as being exploitation, and what it will tolerate.  how is this relevant to our future freedom? in a world that is becoming increasingly global, individuals become increasingly dependent upon corporations and institutions that are increasingly less dependent upon individuals. as an example, even if the chinese factory workers would join hands and refuse to put up with the low salaries and exploitation they suffer in a sweatshop, globalism means that the corporation would be free to pack up its bags and move to another country that is less developed than china. indonesians, indians and nigerians may be quite willing to carry out whatever work the chinese consider exploitation. work increasingly revolves around programming machines, which is the type of work that can be easily outsourced through the internet.  but what about import tariffs then? import tariffs, to boycott products made through exploitation do not solve the problem, as our society is now interdependent. if our governments would seek to end exploitation in foreign countries through import tariffs, such governments would react by no longer selling us whatever minerals or resources we are dependent upon from *them*. the reason the world has moved towards free trade is not as a result of an ideological belief, but because economic growth mandates free trade.  it is possible of course that most or even all of our jobs are instead simply abolished. a (mostly) automated government will provide us all with whatever resources we need to survive, and we are instead left to pursue whatever goals we create for ourselves. in this case, our freedom is reduced to absolutely zero, because besides personally as individuals having no power to influence the conditions of our environment, we are completely dependent upon institutions that are not reciprocally dependent upon us. we will be like lab rats without experiencing the torture done in the name of medical science.  such a condition might seem satisfactory at first, but it is not. humans have a strong instinct to want to take care of each other, and to carry out real tasks that have real consequences and contribute to our survival. in a society where we are left to carry out our hobbies all the time and without any real work that needs to be done, humans would suffer from depression and consider themselves to be useless. families would fall apart, as there is no more dependence of family members upon one another. humans would have to be sedated with pharmaceutical drugs, or somehow be genetically rendered content with serving no purpose. this could happen by a process of slow evolution, in which humans who become depressed kill themselves before having children or simply fail to find a spouse. alternatively, humans may choose to ensure that their children are domesticated enough to accept having no power, and being completely unnecessary cogs in a global machine that exists solely to take care of them.  after this transitional period would be over, and humans would accept their new situation, they would probably be relatively content, but they would not be free, and furthermore, would probably be incapable of recognizing that they are not free. they would resemble ants more than humans, serving a larger global system in which they have no power as individuals, while completely unaware that they have no such power.  it is very likely that humans will soon be aware of their children's genetic code and its implications before birth. as an example, it may be possible to improve the iq or life expectancy of a child with a certain genetic variation by screening children before birth, and ensuring that children with this genetic variation receive the right diet. this is not a far fetched scenario, as studies have already shown that breastfeeding improves iq scores, *but only in children with certain genetic variations*.  further mandating such interventions may be the fact that many of the diseases that plague us at old age emerge before birth. it may be necessary to intervene in children through dietary or medicinal interventions before birth, to prevent symptoms of diseases that only become relevant at old age. how many parents would dare to refuse to have their child tested and medicated before birth, if it guaranteed a delay of alzheimer's disease by five years?  similarly, if we can intervene through dietary interventions before birth, what will stop us from intervening genetically? since we know the genetic variations that lead to huntington's disease, to alzheimer's, to diabetes and to blindness, why would we choose not to prevent our children from being born with such afflictions? we would not start out with protecting children against alzheimer's of course. we are currently starting out by preventing girls from developing breast cancer by only implanting embryos that do not carry the genes predisposing us to breast cancer. we will soon move on to preventing people from passing on huntington's disease to their children, and preventing children from inheriting genes causing mild cognitive disability.  however, by eliminating the genetic underclass of people with inherited ailments, we turn average people with mild abnormalities into the new genetic underclass. if huntington's disease is today a stigma that people seek to keep secret from their community to prevent their children from facing problems when finding a spouse to marry, the eradication of huntington's disease will turn alzheimer's disease carriers into the new genetic underclass, anxious to have their hereditary curse eliminated. similarly, if people who presently have an iq below 70 are all treated, those with an iq slightly above 70 start facing the stigma of being ""cognitively disabled"".  humans have an imagine of beauty that is close to a very average human face. through genetic interventions, we will be capable of giving birth to children closer to the average face than our children would be through natural reproduction. as an example, we might ensure that our children do not inherit our very short stature, or our very large ears. hence, through genetic intervention, we will eventually eliminate human aesthetic diversity.  in the process of doing so, we will think that we are helping our children to become more beautiful. however, with every aesthetic abnormality that is eliminated, the standard for beauty is further raised, because beauty is relative. if a man who is below 5 feet is currently too short to be considered attractive to women, genetic tinkering to ensure all men born will grow to be above 5 feet will mean that men who are 5'1 will now be too short to be attractive.

996631,"as a general rule, you should never take landscape shots without a tripod. all rules have exceptions, but this one has few.  the reasoning behind that is, as many have mentioned in this thread, the best landscape shots are shot with a small aperture and a low iso setting. this means shutter speeds will get long sometimes. also, even moderately fast shutter speeds are subject to some amount of blur. you might now tell me that you were taught that if you keep your shutter speed faster than the reciprocal of your focal length, you don't have to worry about blur. the 1/f rule, as i understand it, is the point where an average person will be able to take a usable shot 50% of the time. above that line, your chances of getting a usable shot are better than not. vr and is and other mechanisms move this line, some claiming as many as 3 or 4 stops slower, but in truth, you will never get a clearer shot than when you use a tripod with either a remote shutter or a timer. since landscape photography lives in the finer details, and nothing moves in a landscape (hopefully), tripods are perfect.  others have offered great advice on how to adjust your settings, so i won't repeat what they have said (aside from the emphasis on tripods). it all appears to be pretty sound advice to me.  so, let's say you find yourself in the same spot you were in, taking long exposure handheld shots. here's my advice, and it sounds simple, but it could save your shot: take a lot of pictures. once you've done some test shots to make sure your settings are what you want, it's just like shooting a gun. brace your arms or your camera on something if you can. breathe out naturally. don't force the air out, but you'll come to a natural stopping point. it is at that point that you want to press the shutter, so push it halfway, inhale, exhale, shoot. now repeat. don't look at your screen to see if it's blurry. just shoot. take 5-10 shots of the same thing, breathing normally, but pausing after each exhalation to snap a shot. now, if you like, you can look through and delete the obviously blurry ones, or you can wait to do that back on your pc (windows or mac, they're all personal computers).  this won't save all of your shots, but it will undoubtedly improve your chances of getting that one magically clear handheld long exposure, and with digital, it won't cost you a dime.",0,,

415864,"i have a relative who is grossly, morbidly obese, and who needs a handicapped placard.  here is why.  he was always obese as a kid. his parents didn't encourage eating well, and mental disorder isn't the half of it.  he's well over five hundred pounds. gastric bypass? that didn't work. hypnosis? nope. walking desk? nu-uh. he's still a virgin, as far as i know. the technical ability to engage in sexual activity has been long gone for years as far as anyone could tell.  when he could drive, he had to have a reinforced seat installed on tracks so far back it made the backseat a formality, with hand controls.  he lives as a shut-in in a house he bought a few years ago, doing work as an it tech for clients over the phone.  he can't physically walk further than fifty feet without resting. his bones are fracturing under duress, and he has to have a home nurse and living assistant help bathe him every day.  it should probably go without saying that i haven't seen him in person in years. i talk with him over email and chat.  he didn't go to his two younger sisters' weddings; he used a laptop to stream it.  this is someone whose life is so utterly fucked that he has arranged his life so he doesn't have to leave his house. groceries are delivered; his garbage is always taken out for him by his aides.  and if i drove him anywhere i couldn't park and have him walk further than 100 feet because he wouldn't make it.  is he disabled? oh hell yes. is he handicapped? absolutely.  is he handicapped because of his own decisions? yeah. but that doesn't mean he isn't handicapped or disabled.  if he ever wanted to get his life together, it would be far easier for him to get up using the tools available for him now.  he's not able-bodied. at all. yeah, his choices put him there, but the same could be said for a triple amputee who lost his limbs because he said, ""hold my beer"", or someone who lost the ability to walk/stand because he dove headfirst into a hot tub and snapped his neck when drunk and became a parapalegic.  so if we are going to apply a standard to one category of people because of shitty life decisions, i think it behooves us to determine where that slippery slope starts and ends.  did he eat his way there? absolutely. but the guy who lost his foot to diabetes, the woman whose suntanning habit gave her skin cancer, the man who has to wheel oxygen tanks everywhere because he smoked for fifty years...  i'm never going to volunteer to clean my relative's house, or drive him to his doctor, or be a pallbearer at his funeral. he won't change his habits without falling so far down he kills himself; he's had more than enough warning.  but to be absolutely blunt, i do not want to see him or someone like him waddling from the furthest part of the parking lot only to see them keep over and die in the middle of the parking lot, which then means the ambulance has to come figure out how to haul the landwhale away without snapping the gurney.  it may sound cruel but sometimes handicapped privilege isn't about privilege; it's about making it easier for everyone else to function with a tiny minority of people whose situation, regardless of fault, are still a part of society.  i'm not advocating shining that particular turd of his situation or whose fault it is.  he's fat, grossly morbidly obese. he is a human being who can't function in normal society without serious assistance, and who cannot do so without assistance.  but someone who is paralyzed from a drunk driver taking the wrong turn is as equally able-bodied as the guy who decided to try to rocketjump a skateboard after screaming, ""this is jackass!""  and each of those people deserve the same opportunities to change their life and move beyond what they are right now regardless of what put them there.  really, op, what it comes down to is this:  i've got hope that my relative will one day lose 300lbs and get skin surgery and therapy and walk outside to get his mail. i have hope that someone with a traumatic brain injury gets help and learns how to live again without destroying themselves or the people around them.  but punishment for those people whose actions place them where they are feels like putting an attempted suicides in prison for two years or more to make sure they know they did something wrong.  pretty sure everyone who has a handicap sticker due to their weight knows that they fucked up on some level (and even if they have denial about it, there is culpability in their choices).  but if you're going to try to punish people for bad choices you really need to consider exactly how slippery that slope goes, and whether it eventually may extend to choices you yourself made that aren't good ones.",1,,-1

642130,"1: that's fairly normal. the foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. if it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. but in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. it might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so i wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. if it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, i don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. i hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  i know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, i really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. but here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/penis-health/pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. and it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. but, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. i wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. it isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.  but every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.  5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. your reaction is up to you.  most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. so doing it quick and only short glances is best. but curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  it isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  but eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. it's one of those things you get used to. when you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. nobody really does tbh.",0,,

531993,"&gt;the new-wave crap pisses me off to no end. i've been told so many times that crystals and weed can cue ms and dystonia i'm considering turning my wheelchair into some sort of rolling version of coachella.  lol. in tomorrow's news: ""florida man who was hemiplegic ends up quadriplegic after giant crystal falls held over his wheelchair falls on him"".   &gt;there's a difference i find in being pc and being a decent person. i'm not pc- but i'm not gonna make someone fee, bad, or be disrespectful towards them because of that.  oh, absolutely. and that doesn't even just apply to someone with a disability, if you're a decent person you wouldn't want to make someone feel bad for no reason. but at the same time, i believe that the reverence created around disabilities and certain conditions actually have the opposite effect. what do you say to a guy on a wheelchair? you say ""hey dude, what's up"". but you see people get visibly uncomfortable when talking to someone with a disability, and you see them bend over backwards trying to be super nice and avoid at all costs even hinting at the existence of the disability. and what you've done is you've turned that guy into his disability, and he is not, he's just a dude, unless we're talking about running a marathon tomorrow, i shouldn't talk to a guy in a wheelchair any differently than i would anybody else.   there is a great tommy edison video about it, [do sighted people think i'm also deaf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqxidk5jlgy) and it recreates a few examples of when sighted people meet him and they totally overact and treat him in a weird way in a strange effort to avoid offending him ... when all they had to do was say ""hey dud, sup"".   of course being disabled is not ideal, but at a certain point, it's part of who you are, you learn to overcome it. we all have limits, and we all know them. at my current 105kg, although i'm fairly athletic for my weight, there are things i couldn't do. i'm not 2 meters tall, i can't jump too high, i couldn't run for 40 minutes if my fucking life depended on it. i have carpal tunnel syndrome from years of riding, using the computer and using tools, so right now i can't really ride comfortably for more than 20 minutes, by right wrist gets inflamed and hurts like hell. i have to use a cordless driver because using a screwdriver by hand and applying any force on a project gets awful after the second or third screw. sure, not huge setbacks, but hey, we all have them, and you accept those things as just who you are, and you acknowledge that other people have capabilities that you don't. not being able to walk, or being blind, are of course a bit more extreme forms of this, but in the end i imagine you deal with it in the same way: that's life and i can't change it, i'll deal with it. and i imagine you kind of forget about it. forget as in, you're not constantly thinking about how you can't walk just as i'm not constantly thinking about what i can and can't do. not that i'm comparing, but i can't fly a plane, but i can drive a car. people that don't drive aren't constantly thinking about how they can't drive a car, using public transportation and walking are normal to them, that's all. so just as you don't think about it all the time, i imagine it's not the best stat to any interaction to be reminded by it because what could be a normal conversation turned into the other guy being all extra nice and weird because you have 18'' rims.   also, luckily we're not in the fucking dark ages anymore. not having use of your lower body in the middle ages probably sucked real hard, and it meant your life went around that. you either belonged to a rich family, or you were relegated to crawling around asking for charity. not the world we live in right now. you probably have a comfortable house, that is adapted to your wheelchair, there is a ramp out front, you can get in a car that is adapted and even probably drive, if not, you can pick up the phone and get a cab or even an uber that is accessible in 5 minutes, you can go to college, you can find a job, you can get a girl. i homework,  i'm a software developer. i could do everything i do right now even if i was completely paralyzed, and it wouldn't alter my work routine all that much. i guess i would have to finally fix that fucking front door that doesn't open all the way through, and build a proper ramp to the garage so i don't have to go through the grass, and probably move my bedroom downstairs (or replace the staircase with an elevator, although knowing my obsession with diying the oddest things, i would probably try to build one myself and end up killing myself within a week), probably get hand controls for my car ... and that's about it. first thing i would probably do is teach my dogs to pull me when we go on walks :d.   what i'm saying is that back in the day everything that departed from being a fully-abled white middle-class man fucking sucked, any departure from that was a small tragedy. today? nah. you're not a tragedy, you're just a dude. oh, btw, you roll instead of walking, so fucking what? nothing that i or anybody else can accomplish that you can't, you'll probably just get there in a different way.   my point is, if there is a point to all this rambling, that here is one of the greatest of all times, wayne rainey [back in the day](https://www.cycleworld.com/sites/cycleworld.com/files/styles/1000_1x_/public/images/2017/12/wayne-rainey-yamaha-yzr500.jpg?itok=qjq9d61t&amp;fc=50,50). then his passion for riding costed him [his leg](http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/wayne+rainey+motogp+san+marino+free+practice+3l82cp0qgryl.jpg). where is he now?

334372,"most countries in the modern world have _very_ broad protections for disabilities in general, intended to allow people experiencing temporary or permanent disability to participate equally in housing, education, employment, public services, and the like. the details vary.  these laws are rarely _required_ by any underlying principle, but they are broadly popular, and even when unpopular, are often viewed by legislators as preferable to allowing disability discrimination unchecked.  these frameworks rarely require legislators to enumerate specific disabilities. to use my local framework (the _access for ontarians with disabilities act_, or aoda):  -----  ‚Äúdisability‚Äù means,  (a) any degree of physical disability, infirmity, malformation or disfigurement that is caused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, a brain injury, any degree of paralysis, amputation, lack of physical co-ordination, blindness or visual impediment, deafness or hearing impediment, muteness or speech impediment, or physical reliance on a guide dog or other animal or on a wheelchair or other remedial appliance or device,  (b) a condition of mental impairment or a developmental disability,  (c) a learning disability, or a dysfunction in one or more of the processes involved in understanding or using symbols or spoken language,  (d) a mental disorder, or  (e) an injury or disability for which benefits were claimed or received under the insurance plan established under the workplace safety and insurance act, 1997; (‚Äúhandicap‚Äù)  -----  allergies, pku, and myriad other rare ailments fit within this framework without having to be specifically named. since the province has seen fit to prohibit disability discrimination and to create a positive duty to accommodate (situationally) for disabilities in general, pku, allergies, and so on are automatically included in the scope of this act. similar reasoning applies to the americans with disabilities act:  -----  as used in this chapter:  (1) disability  the term ‚Äúdisability‚Äù means, with respect to an individual‚Äî  (a) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;  (b) a record of such an impairment; or  (c) being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3)).  (2) major life activities  (a) in general  for purposes of paragraph (1), major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.  (b) major bodily functions  for purposes of paragraph (1), a major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.  (3) regarded as having such an impairment  for purposes of paragraph (1)(c):  (a) an individual meets the requirement of ‚Äúbeing regarded as having such an impairment‚Äù if the individual establishes that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under this chapter because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity.  (b) paragraph (1)(c) shall not apply to impairments that are transitory and minor. a transitory impairment is an impairment with an actual or expected duration of 6 months or less.  -----  the phrasing is different, and that does lead to differences in application, but they're minor. the broad intention to include all disabilities in the scope of the law is the same.  the province of ontario (for the aoda), or congress (for the ada), _could_ repeal or amend these laws, for example to narrow the scope or to rescind the obligation to accommodate. it would be political suicide, but it would almost certainly be legal, though you can expect that there would be civil rights litigation to verify that against the relevant constitutional rules around equal protection.",1,,0
988832,"i'm going to come at this from a more personal direction. i was born somewhere between 23-26 weeks gestational age, which was the utmost limit of viability at the time, and is not far off from the current limit of viability even with today's medical advancements. i weighed 1.5 lbs. due to ridiculously poor medical care and other factors, my mother only knew that she was pregnant for three weeks before i was born and thus never had the option to abort. it was predicted that i would develop fatal hydrocephalus, or that if i survived i would be in a vegetative state.  instead, i have cerebral palsy. my case is mild in that i don't have an intellectual disability, i overcame my speech impediment as a child, and i can walk independently. there are shockingly few studies on the prognosis for adults with cp, but i don't expect that my lifespan will be affected by it; however, i am likely to develop osteoarthritis by the time i'm 30, and at 25 i already feel the effect on the joints in the lower half of my body. yet, knowing that things turned out extremely well for me considering the circumstances, i would not fault my mother if she had aborted me, had she been able. the odds wer absolutely against me. down's syndrome is, of course, a different disorder and, like me, some people with ds manage to lead relatively average lives; but their lifespans are significantly shorter, and  even in then they face a much higher risk of several painful and dangerous medical conditions that would reduce a person's quality of life.  i strongly dislike the phrase ""differently-abled."" there is nothing which cerebral palsy allows me to do that an able-bodied person cannot. there are a lot things that i cannot and will never be able to do because of it, and many other things that are more difficult and physically painful for me than they would otherwise be. i am literally *less* able. in a small measure, my *potential* as a human being has been diminished. my *dignity* as a human being has not. it remains equal to anyone else's and would regardless of the severity of my disability. unless there were an absolute cure, nothing can remove the limitations that cerebral palsy has put on me, and medical treatment has expanded those boundaries about as far as they can go. although there are doubtlessly plenty of ways that society might better accommodate me, no amount of accommodation will alter the fact that i am disabled. if i lived alone in a culture-free void, basic locomotion would still be painful and taxing for me. so understand that i am not parroting back some brainwashed prejudice. to present my physical capabilities as different but equal to an able-bodied person's is to deny a fundamental tenet of my actual experience. there may well be people out there with disabilities who feel that they gain something equal or better than what the unimpaired would, but that definitely does not apply universally.  what can change is the degree to which society acknowledges disabled people's inherent and equal dignity as a human beings. aborting a fetus that has down's syndrome in favor of one that possesses more physical and intellectual potential does not and cannot reduce the dignity of living people who have ds. nor do i think it would reflect an attempt to negate those people's dignity. it's simply a parent's natural desire for their child to have the best life possible.",1,,-1
755498,"i'm in human services. i'm a big fan of person first language in my field for the sole reason that it is so easy to start thinking about the people we work with as their diagnosis. i'm seeing the bpd at noon, the autism at two, the class of cps at four, etc. so many colleagues would be focusing on the medical condition and the accessibility barriers because that's literally our jobs, that we do sometimes have to be reminded of the person themselves. for us, the person is one of ten or twelve we work with that day. for them, this is their life. so i like using it at work because our language is important and reminds us of why we do what we do.  as a person with a mental health disability, i will be god damned before i allow my suicidal bullshit to define me or my identity. i'm not a depressive person. i'm a person with major depression. and yeah, it screwed with my life in multiple ways over the past few decades, but it's something i live with, not something that defines me. so i like having the option. i don't mind disabled person though, especially when it's in an appropriate context.  however, when i'm speaking with and about other disabled people outside of a professional setting (and even at work, with colleagues who don't usually need reminding), i tend to oscillate between disabled people and people with disabilities. i use autistic person exclusively, as the autistic community is pretty vocal about their preferences. same with blind person, deaf person, etc. the id/dd group, at least from what i've seen and experienced, tends to favor person first, so i've been using that but can change if it seems they prefer the other.   i refuse to use wheelchair bound or bed bound though. gross. wheelchair user.  differently abled, handi capable, special needs, all of it is language meant to avoid using disabled and try to spin it in a better light. i manage a staff of 20. every one of them has different abilities. the term means nothing useful.",1,,1

959132,"abomination? burden on the community? really?! sounds like some people need to enlighten themselves and learn a little about compassion, empathy, and acceptance of differences! i have a brother with down syndrome and i am a special education teacher and let me tell you that i wouldn't trade him or any of my students for the world. yes it's not easy but most things worthwhile don't come easy. i can say that being a younger sibling and the only sibling of someone with special needs that i have been enlightened and exposed to things most children/adults do not get to experience/ benefit from and one thing for sure is that i don't take my abilities for granted. i also rarely if ever felt left out because my parents made a conscious choice to make sure i got special attention was included at all times. yes it is true that people with disabilities can have a lot if health issues but not always!! my brother for example did have a hole in his heart but after it's repair he hasn't had any major health issues... others aren't so lucky but many are. i mean you could have a completely normal child who is physically disabled because something didn't develop, they have spinabifida, cerebral palsy, or something else but their brain is fine. you could also have a child who doesn't have any issues mentally but has celiac disease, developed cancer, or diabetes. they cost a lot of money too. you don't have to be disabled to have a lot of medical needs. no one can for certain predict what a child can and cannot do. if you set the bar high and give a child tools to be successful they will be. i have seen this countless times. just like doctors cannot for sure predict if a child will have downs or some other disease. yes there are tests but they are not 100% correct every time. i have had 4 people tell me that they were told after several tests that their unborn child had downs and guess what... when their baby was born... no downs! so there are no guarantees either way. i have a student whose mom had a normal pregnancy, all the tests came back normal and guess what when she was born she was not able to shut her mouth because the bones had not developed properly. so this student has a trach and a gi tube, and has to use sign language to communicate.  another friend had not one but two daughters that are deaf, she didn't know that would be the case until after the fact.   for those who don't think they can handle having a child with disabilities... how do you know what you can handle or not. speaking from experience you'd be surprised what you can handle when there's no other option.  another comment mentioned the type of life some of these people have with being made fun of... if the child is surrounded by a supportive, loving family that advocates for them as well as educates people around them, it leaves very little room for people to make fun. i know kids can be cruel but you know what a lot more are accepting as long as they have positive role models, that they can learn from. i won't say it never happens but it depends on how it's handled. i work at a middle school and middle schoolers tend to be crueler than most. today there was a student who made a nasty comment about one of my students, before i could reprimand the student and find out their name so i could request that they come spend some time in my classroom another student said "" that's not cool.. they can't help it ""and the student actually apologized.   there was also a comment about the quality of life these people have... many people with disabilities have jobs, participate in sports, have spouses/significant others, drive etc. how is that different from you or i? yes, many can't but how do you know what their quality of life is unless they have the opportunity to have a life? also how do you know they aren't happy with their life because it's your perspective that they are missing out? many don't know that they are ""missing out."" do you realize how many things people with disabilities don't have to worry about, which makes many of us ""normal"" people stressed, anxious etc.  and let me remind all of those people who were are saying that kids with downs or other limiting diseases should be aborted, these kids never asked for this, sometimes it's because their parents didn't take care of themselves or simply didn't care that their actions could affect their unborn child! also at anytime any one of you could get into an accident, have a traumatic brain injury, become paralyzed or both and guess what you are in the same damn boat as some of these kids that you are claiming should be aborted.",1,,2
517826,"i work with special needs students. that's what most people call it in my district. the terms ""intellectually impaired"" ""physically impaired"" ""deaf and hard-of-hearing"" ""visually impaired"" and ""sld"" (specific learning disability) are also used. i also have what i consider a minor disability for which i sometimes need accomodations or additional help.   i really just feel like i'm tired of non-disabled people feeling like they get to decide how we collectively describe people with disabilities. most people with disabilities don't give a flying flip and honestly they'd rather you not sugar coat it.   i'm all for ""special olympics"" and programs that help kids see what they're capable of, because they lessen the problem of learned helplessness- we don't want kids moping around saying they can't when they're capable. however, that doesn't mean we get to decide what they can and cannot do, that's their call. we can encourage them to push themselves, of course, but nobody should ever be told they're making stuff up or being lazy because they need help or a break.   in my opinion the problem lies in calling a disability something else and acting like it's not a big deal. there's a fine line between not being defined by your disability and ignoring it altogether.   people who have disabilities, after a certain age/development, should definitely have a say in how we identify their disability, how we identity them as a person, and what accomodations they need to function as normally as possible. for younger kids or those with severe disabilities, these decisions lie with the parents or primary caregiver, but any time the person affected is able to give their input it should be their right to decide.   if a blind person says they're blind and they need accomodations, give them to them. they don't want to read braille for fun i guarantee you. if a deaf person says they *don't* want to be defined by their disability, *don't do that.* if a kid in a wheelchair asks you to push them, don't tell them they just need to get stronger- that's none of your business and not your call (and if they say they *don't* need you to push, stop pushing!).   tl;dr: let people be people and be respectful no matter what. ask the person what they think before you give unsolicited help or label them, believe them when they ask for help. it's up to the person how much help they need and how often they need it.   also: feel free to ask me questions or for clarification. not always sure i'm conveying my point clearly, working on that.  edited to add: a lot of the reason the terms people like to fuss about are still being used because the people who teach, provide therapies to, and otherwise work with people who have disabilities have done so for a very long time. most of the people i work with are in their fifties or even older, and have been doing the same job since their early twenties. i'm only 23, and i've been the youngest person on staff since i started working where i do 5 years ago. it's hard to be told you have to change the vocabulary associated with the job you've been doing 30+ years.",1,-1,1

338432,"first off, im not a socialist - im a capitalist and according to the father of capitalism - adam smith - require not simplistic proportionate taxation but progressive taxation. smith stated ""it is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion"", because a tax on ""the luxuries and vanities of life [which] occasion the principal expense of the rich... would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be anything very unreasonable."" - the notion of the lazy poor ‚Äúwelfare queen‚Äù is largely a myth, the average recipient of public assistance is elderly or disabled.  the proportion of welfare state spending is correlated with median age.  it appears that with many people growing older, and the financial crisis wrecking pensions and 401ks, we have many elderly and disabled individuals who simply do not have the capacity to independently provide for their means.  even with state level welfare programs, the majority of recipients remain elderly and disabled individuals who are unable to obtain employment in the private sector due to physical impossibility. - the libertarian also celebrates charity as it is ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù while taxation is not, therefore the moral purpose behind it is more ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù in their eyes.  this of course could not be further from the truth.  empirical measurements of the efficiency of charities are not encouraging.  the levels of fraud and waste in charities are often higher than those seen in government finances.  while some charities are more efficient than others, the notion that they are somehow more efficient than government is a myth, many charities have a dollar inefficiency rate as high as 95%.  this is even more damning when you take into account that many charities falsify or misrepresent their data.  unlike public expenditures, which are subject to review by the population via things like the freedom of information act, charities are privately run, and have the ability to distort all figures and hide them from objective evaluation.  but those studies which have looked at charity as a whole paint a bleak picture with rampant inefficiency, fraud and abuse.  sending your dollars to charity is certainly no more efficient than having them work through the welfare state, and in fact the data suggests that charity is far less efficient than public welfare. - 10 reason why libertarianism is bullshit 1.  it's impossible.  libertarianism is impossible except for survivalist nutters and hermits.  humans need a social structure because we're a social species.  trusting that humans can moderate their own behavior on their own is just a fantasy.  if we were as sparsely distributed as wolf packs, we could get along in our small groups without intervention from a higher authority in theory.... but the matriarch or patriarch would be the higher authority so even that isn't strictly libertarian.  anyway, we're long past the point in evolution where we could manage our behavior without a formal structure.  michael shermer theorizes the optimal size for a human community to manage without any oversight is about 150.  those days are gone.  2.  it's naive.  it assumes people are basically good.  this is a nice thought, and a refreshing break from the christian belief that all people are sinners who need to be saved, but it's just plain wrong.  just as we differ in our dna we differ in our personalities.  some of us will go through life making very few decisions that negatively impact others, and some of us are sociopaths.  at its best, government protects the truly good from the sociopaths.  without a government, we would be reduced to lynch mobs which can only avenge bad deeds, not prevent them.  and we certainly wouldn't have something like the fbi, which can trace the path of a serial killer from one area to the next based on dna evidence, etc.  i think the people who believe that ""survival of the fittest ergo libertarianism"" probably assume they are the fittest themselves.  they don't think that they would be the victims of a sociopath.  bernie madoff counted on this kind of hubris to make his illegal millions.   3.  it's cold-hearted.  for example, regulations about safety in cars aren't needed because over time car companies would be forced to make safer cars or they'd go out of business.  so the people who died in fires caused by exploding gas tanks in ford pintos, or in wrecks caused by the design of their corvair were just collateral damage in the evolution of better cars.  people who died because of unregulated businesses did nothing to deserve that fate, except perhaps not be able to afford better cars.  and the pseudo-darwinism of libertarianism really doesn't care what the strong do to the weak.  rich and powerful people are good and deserve to be rich and powerful.  the poor and powerless deserve what they get.  4.  it ignores history.  we haven't always had a u.s. government.  it's only a little more than 200 years old.  but we do know earlier forms of society.  we've had monarchies.  we've had theocracies.  we had the ancient roman &amp; greek systems that privileged people with money.  modern democracy certainly has its failings, but we really be better off returning to ""less"" government considering what our previous systems gave us?  5.  it's not natural.  the underlying assumption of libertarianism is that government is an artificial construct that interferes with natural behavior, which they believe works just fine on its own.  there's no evidence that humanity could have survived without some form of social organization.  the instinct for survival that causes some to climb to the top of the heap and others to hide from the climbers just doesn't result in a society that works for large numbers.  it probably won't work for small numbers, either.    6.  it ignores human failings.  we no longer live in family groups in tiny villages, and if libertarianism became the ""law"" of the land, we would pretty much have to go back to that.  in our distant past, we helped each other within our own group and competed against other groups for resources.  surviving without a government would require all of us to gather into small groups for protection and predation.  child abuse and spousal abuse would again be perpetrated with no recourse.  victims of alcoholism or mental illness would have no access to services, and their families would suffer.  a small group's only hope of survival when ""infected"" with a defective member would be to ostracize that member.   7.  it ignores human compassion.  libertarianism denies the instinct to help others, which has been shown in other species as well. government taking a role in ""lifting up"" the poor is an extension of the instinct we would follow individually in a smaller group.   by blaming the victim, libertarians can imagine themselves the agents of their own good luck.  there's no place in their worldview for helping the blind, the deaf, the physically impaired, or the children of these people.  the mentally ill who are incapable of working for a living due to their illness?  *shrug*  at least religions have charities that make a dent in these issues.  secular libertarians leave the powerless to their own devices as if blindness or mental illness were somehow the victim's own fault.  there have been hundreds if not thousands of examples of other animals helping each other or even other species, so compassion seems to be instinctual.  i have yet to meet a libertarian who has a relative that needs help to survive.  if i had the power to curse people, i'd curse libertarians with multiple sclerosis.  let's see how many ways they make use of the ada law's provisions.  8.  it ignores somalia.  somalia is the perfect example of libertarianism in action. there's basically no government in somalia so we can see what would happen.   without a government, pirates and tribal groups terrorize others.  women and children are mistreated.  disease is rampant.  there's no viable business other than crime.  it's a chaotic mess.  why would anyone want to copy that model?  9.  it's selfish.  on the surface, penn jillette saying that he doesn't know what's best for someone else seems humble and charitable.  but really, sometimes he would know what's best.  he would know that a woman being beaten on a daily basis by an abusive husband would be better off if she could get out of that situation.  he would know that someone with asthma would be better off in a world with less air pollution.  his pseudo-humility covers up a basic unwillingness to get involved.  or, he's got his head in the sand when it comes to the problems of society and of individuals that are just too big or complicated for a family or small group to help with.  10.  it's provincial.  it ignores the fact that the economies and socieities of all the world's nations are now interconnected.  if someone lives in the country with well water, septic tank and a burn pit for their garbage, they can fantasize they are not relying on the government.  but then when their four-year-old comes down with cancer, they're only too happy to take him to the big city hospital for chemo that was studied using federal funding.  so...  i call bullshit on libertarianism.",1,,0

764800,"i am back a computer where i can type better.  so full disclosure on my where i get my knowledge and my experiences and biases.  i work for a 7300 person not for profit, very well known.   i am what we call a senior middle manager, with 60 staff and a few hundred million in labs under me.  my father-in-law was one of the top law attorneys in the us, but sadly is retired and fighting cancer.  i have bounced what i run into in life and work off of him.   i have been in this role 10 years.  i am disabled myself, qualify for a dog but didn't go that route, walking stability issues.  my daughter has severe pots and has a dog, two of my employees had ptsd, one had cerebral palsy and has no use of most of his body neck down, and i had a full deaf staff member as well.  one of my ptsd staff, attempted to bring the first dog to our employer.   he is a friend as most of my staff are, and i have been with him to testify to get him a dog, been at the training with a nationally recognized organization, and battled my employer to get that dog at work with him.  so here's how the laws play.  there are laws for public access for the disabled that mostly were written for wheelchairs, and a few for the blind.  these are applied to both places you go to shop, eat, etc. and to the actual employer for their staff.  states, counties, cities, and municipalities can add more, but generally they cannot take away from these basic laws and associated codes.  these are parking spaces, ramps, door widths, large bathroom stall with a higher toilet, brail in the elevator, elevator buttons lowered or kick buttons, etc.   these are to allow certain disabilities access to move about as non disabled people do.  the law has very specific language for public access of service dogs...we all know those here.  it calls out dogs and what rights the person has to move about anywhere they choose, etc. just like non-disabled people.  there are exceptions regarding things like food safety.     the ada laws on the employer as they apply to their staff needs beyond these basic access things like ramps are relatively soft.  they do not ever call out a dog, and they describe reasonable accommodation.  that is to allow the employer to consider cost, impact to others etc.   let's start with hiring.  the law says i cant not hire you because you are disabled.  that is true, but it does allow me to not give you a certain job that you cannot accomplish if disabled...i am allowed to examine what it would take to get you to do it, your safety in that, others, cost etc., and say no.  so take my guy who can't move from the neck down.  i do not have to give him a job lifting heavy things or climbing ladders.  to do so would require large expensive machines which is unreasonable and i can say no...and typically one would be steered toward a position that does not require such costs.  walmart is a good example.  they hire many disabled people and place them where they can do a job within their disability limits.  they thus have not not hired you, but they also have not done anything special to give you a job beyond your disability.   and this then gets to the heart of ada on employers, it is all about reasonable.  they don't have to do much beyond the standard access things provided they can show the cost, or adverse impacts on others etc., thus failing the reasonable part of the accommodation.  thus i had my deaf staff member miss fire alarms....guess what he can't hear them.  i requested a flashing light be place near his office and in labs he worked in.  they decided it was too expensive and the solution they came up with deemed reasonable and thus legal was to tell the 60 people in the group remember in a fire to look for him and get him out.  now we all are out and about in meetings, we own 16 labs, we have 33 offices, and something near 500 acres of buildings etc.  i can't say he would always be somewhere where we knew for sure he was there....thus this really is no solution.  but by law it was fine, they say people will find him, case closed.   as noted we attempted to get the first dog in.   it was denied.  we asked the whole group and our neighbors in our office floor, no one objected.  the employer claim is some people are scared by dogs and others have allergies.  it is not fair to those staff or potentially customers or others who visit us to have the dog.  and that stood legally.   there was no way to accommodate a dog, office type buildings make so you have common air etc., and thus they could deny this legally.  so that sadly is how it plays out.   hence all my point was to say i actually do think an employer who allows dogs to support staff are noteworthy for what i see in general is a lot of attempts to block them using things like allergies.   it's actually why i didn't go that route myself...i already saw this play out at work so i knew well i couldn't have a dog either and i am vested there, use the benefits for my kids college etc., so i wasn't going to quit over it.  so that is all i was doing is providing some insight into how employer laws work and no they are not required by law to allow your dog or even hire you with your disability.",1,,0

951380,"ffvi has the simplest, most direct story i've played (i, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, halfway through viii, ix, and x). there is an ancient magic, an evil empire with a crazy general, and a ragtag team of misfits trying to stop them. that's essentially it.  other than the crazy general winning round 1, the plot structure of ffvi is very simple and predictable.  ffvi is basically magitek star wars with darth vader having a huge victory (and even overtly references star wars a couple of times). and that's *good*! people like hearing a story they already know! it's nice to recognise familiar archetypes in a story. that makes it easier to relate to, and usually that's why people like hearing stories, to see parts of themselves in the story.  further to this, the simple plot structure of ffvi is combined with a lot of characters. despite various limitations that prevented the characters from all being fully fleshed out, the skeleton plot above allows each character to have their day in the spotlight, highlighting her or his motivation for fighting the empire or its crazy general and their overall involvement with the rest of the plot. so each little personal drama that each character can have (including [mog's deeply tragic story](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasy/comments/8k13x9/most_criminally_underrated_and_tragically_unlucky/) that i can't shut up about) adds to the depth of ffvi's story.  i think other games that may be argued to be more popular (such as the undeniably groundbreaking ffvii) are more remembered for atmosphere, gameplay, or aesthetics than for their story. in ffvii's case, for example, the story is a jumbled mess that many players still have difficulty understanding [and need to have it explained it to them](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasy/comments/3vv41c/ff7s_english_translation_was_not_complete_and/).  this happens for many other of the games in the series. ff stories tend to have a huge fake outs. characters you thought were people turn out to not be people but clones, dreams, androids. villains turn out be manipulated or not villains at all. the world you're in turns out to not be the world at all but part of another planet/timeline/dimension. these fake outs tend to cheapen the story a little and make the player a little cheated, like all of the emotion invested in a character or place turns out to be wasted. it's a kind of variation of ""it was all a dream"" which always makes stories a little unfulfilling, making you feel that all that drama was for nothing.",0,,

829830,"teachers have held up helen keller, the blind and deaf girl who overcame her physical handicaps, as an inspiration to generations of schoolchildren. every fifth grader knows the scene in which anne sullivan spells *water* into young helen‚Äôs hand at the pump. at least a dozen movies and filmstrips have been made on keller‚Äôs life. each yields its version of the same clich√©. a mcgraw-hill educational film concludes: ‚Äúthe gift of helen keller and anne sullivan to the world is to constantly remind us of the wonder of the world around us and how much we owe those who taught us what it means, for there is no person that is unworthy or incapable of being helped, and the greatest service any person can make us is to help another reach true potential.‚Äù  to draw such a bland maxim from the life of helen keller, historians and filmmakers have disregarded her actual biography and left out the lessons she specifically asked us to learn from it. keller, who struggled so valiantly to learn to speak, has been made mute by history. the result is that we really don‚Äôt know much about her.  over the past twenty years, i have asked hundreds of college students who helen keller was and what she did. all know that she was a blind and deaf girl. most remember that she was befriended by a teacher, anne sullivan, and learned to read and write and even to speak. some can recall rather minute details of keller‚Äôs early life: that she lived in alabama, that she was unruly and without manners before sullivan came along, and so forth. [untrue and an invention on the part of sullivan's, all other accounts say she was already well-behaved] a few know that keller graduated from college. but about what happened next, about the whole of her adult life, they are ignorant. a few students venture that keller became a ‚Äúpublic figure‚Äù or a ‚Äúhumanitarian,‚Äù perhaps on behalf of the blind or deaf. ‚Äúshe wrote, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù or ‚Äúshe spoke‚Äù‚Äîconjectures without content. keller, who was born in 1880, graduated from radcliffe in 1904 and died in 1968. to ignore the sixty-four years of her adult life or to encapsulate them with the single word *humanitarian* is to lie by omission.  the truth is that helen keller was a radical socialist. she joined the socialist party of massachusetts in 1909. she had become a social radical even before she graduated from radcliffe, and *not*, she emphasized, because of any teachings available there. after the russian revolution, she sang the praises of the new communist nation: ‚Äúin the east a new star is risen! with pain and anguish the old order has given birth to the new, and behold in the east a man-child is born! onward, comrades, all together! onward to the campfires of russia! onward to the coming dawn!‚Äù keller hung a red flag over the desk in her study. gradually she moved to the left of the socialist party and became a wobbly, a member of the industrial workers of the world (iww), the syndicalist union persecuted by woodrow wilson.  keller‚Äôs commitment to socialism stemmed from her experience as a disabled person and from her sympathy for others with handicaps. she began by working to simplify the alphabet for the blind, but soon came to realize that to deal solely with blindness was to treat symptom, not cause. through research she learned that blindness was not distributed randomly throughout the population but was concentrated in the lower class. men who were poor might be blinded in industrial accidents or by inadequate medical care; poor women who became prostitutes faced the additional danger of syphilitic blindness. thus keller learned how the social class system controls people‚Äôs opportunities in life, sometimes determining even whether they can see. keller‚Äôs research was not just book learning: ‚Äúi have visited sweatshops, factories, crowded slums. if i could not see it, i could smell it.‚Äù  at the time keller became a socialist, she was one of the most famous women on the planet. she soon became the most notorious. her conversion to socialism caused a new storm of publicity‚Äîthis time outraged. newspapers that had extolled her courage and intelligence now emphasized her handicap. columnists charged that she had no independent sensory input and was in thrall to those who fed her information. typical was the editor of the *brooklyn eagle*, who wrote that keller‚Äôs ‚Äúmistakes spring out of the manifest limitations of her development.‚Äù  keller recalled having met this editor: ‚Äúat that time the compliments he paid me were so generous that i blush to remember them. but now that i have come out for socialism he reminds me and the public that i am blind and deaf and especially liable to error. i must have shrunk in intelligence during the years since i met him.‚Äù she went on, ‚Äúoh, ridiculous *brooklyn eagle*! socially blind and deaf, it defends an intolerable system, a system that is the cause of much of the physical blindness and deafness which we are trying to prevent.‚Äù  keller, who devoted much of her later life to raising funds for the american foundation for the blind, never wavered in her belief that our society needed radical change. having herself fought so hard to speak, she helped found the american civil liberties union to fight for the free speech of others. she sent $100 to the naacp with a letter of support that appeared in its magazine *the crisis*‚Äîa radical act for a white person from alabama in the 1920s. she supported eugene v. debs, the socialist candidate, in each of his campaigns for the presidency. she composed essays on the women‚Äôs movement, on politics, on economics. near the end of her life, she wrote to elizabeth gurley flynn, leader of the american communist party, who was then languishing in jail, a victim of the mccarthy era: ‚Äúloving birthday greetings, dear elizabeth flynn! may the sense of serving mankind bring strength and peace into your brave heart!‚Äù  ---  from [*lies my teacher told me*](https://4.files.edl.io/0ec3/06/28/18/155729-1b8ab639-28ff-4b2d-858e-4ecf1f9cbbc4.pdf) by james loewen",1,,2

587789,"i found this very confusing. it was interesting to hear the experiences of the people interviewed.   but, the interviewees said things that did not make a lot of sense and/or conflicted with themselves or each other.  the woman with the blind husband, was dismissive of a waiter asking her for her husband's order (an attempt to 'help' the blind man and also avoid the social quandary of asking a blind man to read a menu, which he may or may not be able to do). do you think the waiter cares to find out? should they sit down and conduct an interview with the man to determine his capabilities? no-one is important, disabled or not. the waiter wants your order fast and smooth. when a non-disabled person is asked for their order do they think 'they assumed i could hear', 'they assumed i can read'? assumptions are the oil on the social machinery that makes life run smooth, it is just part of life.  socially, a huge amount of people are unable to engage in meeting people, they are not comfortable to approach someone else first. because the blind woman 'can't', others must do that for her? (i.e. make an assumption and 'help' her, stigmatise her as 'unable to initiate social interactions'). the blind woman found it a negative that people spoke slowly or loudly to her (an assumption designed to help her, albeit a wrong one). yet on the other hand it was positive she got a dog by which people approached her and offered help. the dog seems to be quite a 'label' whereby people can easily pigeon-hole someone and put them in the 'blind box'. this kind of visible label allows people to more readily 'make assumptions' about a person's disability, rather than ignoring the loud, embarrassing woman trying to attract their attention. that is, she was happy to be 'stigmatised' in some form when she wants social interaction or help.  the deaf woman found the speech therapy in her childhood a negative experience, yet wanted someone to find her a friend at university. the speech therapy thing was really about her not liking being singled out (different/separate) from others. at the age of eight a deaf child is not a good judge of whether their speech is fine or not. if as an adult you still think you were correct as a child of eight, then you are probably not the most balanced thinker. why the hate for people attempting to 'lessen the stigma' (it would be a lot harder socially if you cannot be understood easily) they knew she would face later in life if there wasn't action taken? then on the other hand she wants more separation for disabled people (e.g. a specific residence hall). how is the experience of being separated from her peers in childhood different to the experience of being separated in university?   so after watching this i am lost. is disability an invisible issue? one interviewee claims not, but on the other hand claims people don't want to draw attention to it. do disabled people want help? yes, if it is perfectly tailored to their desires/needs. do they want to be recognised as disabled? yes when they choose it, no when it doesn't suit them.  as a non-disabled person i left this feeling: i was earnest, i gave you my time, my ear, i was prepared to think about what you said, to change my behaviour. after watching i feel like wtf do you want? you are pretty normal in that you are just as self-centred and fucked up as everyone else who has no clue to why they are unhappy and blame external circumstances.  i am sorry, you live in a world of 7 billion people, no one is important, we are all invisible in one way or another, it is not your struggle alone. realise people's default interaction with you is one of convenience, it works most of the time, that you are different is not the issue. no one cares about you as much as no one cares about non-disabled people.",1,,-2

688465,"quote from nimrah: &gt; they only things that i have said about what i believe are: i am pro-deaf, i do not view it as a disability, i want the parents of a deaf child to learn as much about asl and deaf culture as possible and to expose their child to it as well and i want those parents to do everything that they can to not view their child as abnormal and constantly take steps to ""fix"" something that may not actually be broken.  i now have a clearer understanding of your stance. you are saying that there's nothing wrong with being deaf (no cochlear), and you may be right (there's a great deaf community, right?). you blame the parents for their ignorance (that being deaf is okay and it does not need to be ""fixed""). however, why you blame people because they are ignorant of something is beyond me. perhaps the deaf community should take all of the blame for not getting their voice out there? what have they been doing instead? forming their own community and shutting everyone else out, apparently.  let's face it. deafness is a disability, cochlear or not. you're damn right people are going to try to fix that, especially in this millenium. the deaf community is shrinking, and i understand that. the trend due to technology (more of the newer deaf generations are getting cochlear implants) is changing. according to the deaf community, getting an implant is like getting a mercedes, when a honda will do just fine.  again, let's face it. most of the world isn't deaf. being fixed will give a disabled person more opportunities, more fun, more life. it's true. giving a boy a prosthetic leg will allow him run, and who doesn't like to run, whether or not there is a huge, well supported community of one leggers out there?  if the deaf community truly feel that deaf people do not need an implant, they should be feeling sorry for those who do get one. but no, it must be something else, because instead, they stomp on them, disrespect them, and shun them away, shrinking their community even more.  i wouldn't be surprised if deaf interpreters are non-existant in the next decade or so. if i were you, i would start acquiring a new skill.",1,,-2

(i wonder where they're going with the other six). their response is two parts.  first: ""disabilities are rarely *total* disabilities. there are different types, different degrees and people compensate in different ways."" no fucking shit. say something relevant.  second: ""disability is natural, and is therefore neither good nor bad."" total non-sequitur, and ethically false. i feel sorry for anyone with such a pathetic philosophical framework that they think a severe handicap such as ""inability to perceive the world using vision"" isn't bad. it is bad. humans are born with capabilities that are integral to our survival and happiness. among these are reason, locomotion, vision, and plenty of others. the inability to exercise one of these fundamental aspects of our being does us harm. what other standard of good and bad is there?  &gt;**i would never use the n-word because people of color are part of an oppressed group. but disabled people aren‚Äôt really oppressed. are they?**  the response is basically ""yeah they're totally oppressed, just look at unemployment rates."" if you can't think of any reason that might be the case besides oppression, you're retarded. the reduced ability to provide for oneself is one of the reasons why disabilities are bad.   i'm going to wager that the author has marxist leanings, and doesn't believe that one's productive capacity has anything to do with whether they should have a job. but that would require a whole different breakdown of why they're stupid.   &gt;**if my disabled friend says it‚Äôs okay to use these words, doesn‚Äôt that make it all right to use them?**  ""it should go without saying, but think for yourself about the impact of the language you‚Äôre using."" thanks, i'll do that.  geez, that's only 6.  &gt; **i don‚Äôt know why we all have to be so careful about giving offense. shouldn‚Äôt people just grow thicker skins?**  yay, another not totally straw man!   ""for me, it is not a question of personal offense, but of political and social impact."" i see. i think that's actually totally fair! however, in terms of social impact, i don't see anything wrong with maintaining the notion that it's bad when bad things happen to people.   &gt; **aren‚Äôt you just a member of the pc police trying to take away my first amendment rights?**  oh i get it. this is just the previous one except turned into an angry straw man. toast away.  &gt; **aren‚Äôt you playing oppression olympics here?**  what the author *actually* responds to is not this question, but instead **""hey, i'm more oppressed than you! stop stealing my oppression thunder!""** in other words, they're responding to *someone else* playing oppression olympics.  and the hilarious response to this is to say ""want to stop being insulted? then stop condoning disabilities being used as insults!"" why stop there, i have no idea. if that line of persuasion were effective, then why not just ban all insults, and pretend that there are no bad things?  &gt; **why can‚Äôt we use disability slurs when the target is actually a nondisabled person?**  whoa, i thought that's what we were talking about this whole time. didn't this article begin by talking about general, even abstract, things like ""the economy being crippled?"" who the fuck is out there saying that it's okay to use ""ableist"" language because they want to insult disabled people? first of all, no one, and second, that's wrong for reasons entirely unrelated to the *language* being used.  the author's response basically just begs the whole question of the article. they say it's bad to associate *rationally deficient* decision making with mental disabilities. they say it's bad to call something ""lame"" for being bad. why? why is it bad to compare something bad to something else bad? that's the fundamental question, which was answered *stupidly* in question 4.   ""someone who has no consciousness of racism or homophobia will be called blind or deaf to the issues, and yet, such lack of consciousness runs rampant among non-disabled people."" hmm, maybe we could come up with some concise word to describe a ""lack of consciousness of a particular aspect of reality."" maybe there are some words that already describe related things that we could use to describe that fundamental principle more generally.  &gt;as far as i can see, lousy foreign policy, lousy hollywood films, and lousy comments about race and sexual orientation are by far the province of so-called normal people.  check your not-covered-in-lice privilege.",1,,2

585275,"it's completely possible that someone would get on our case about it. it's happened over and over to people in various disability communities i'm a part of. it's a major reason why we are trapped at home and cannot go out because 1. people don't respect not coming into our 6 foot bubble and 2. we'd be asked to mask our daughter or leave.  i would also challenge your statement ""when a fully able-bodied and sound-minded individual isn't wearing a mask for ""medical reasons..."" i agree that people often fake or exaggerate medical issues as an excuse - i.e. someone claiming anxiety or asthma who does not actually have either of those conditions or they have a mild case and could wear a mask. however, we have to be really careful here. you do not have the right to ask someone their disability or make them ""prove"" it either, per ada. we can't go up to a person with a service dog and start questioning ""do you have epilepsy? are you blind?!"" etc. that's not the experience moving through the world that we should want for our disabled friends and neighbors. they have the right to exist without being questioned about whether their disability is real and whether they actually need the supports and accommodations they have. if you looked at my daughter and i using a handicapped space, you might assume we were using it ""wrongly"" - i'd be parking and then putting her into what looks like a stroller in the space beside the van (but is actually a very expensive adaptive device because she's almost 3 and not yet walking). you wouldn't see my chronic pain, herniated discs, or my heart rate skyrocketing just from standing. i would look like a healthy young mom with a typical looking toddler. you should never judge and assume based on what someone looks like or think they must be faking because you don't see them in a wheelchair or carrying an o2 tank. invisible disabilities are a thing and prejudices against them are real. if anything, we should err on the side of being accommodating to the veruka salts because it would be preferable to accidentally accommodate them rather than denying services to people with real disabilities who are already one of the most disenfranchised and discriminated against populations, even before covid. if someone's living on social security which is less than $1000 per month, are they going to be able to afford to just drive or ride the bus to another grocery store or pay the extra fees for grocery delivery to get around being told they cannot access food because of their inability to wear a mask? probably not. there are also many disabled kids who are not able to access public school because they can't wear a mask which is ludicrous. my daughter will be one of them - she isn't welcome to attend school when she turns 5 so we will have no choice to homeschool. she also lost her physical therapy, ot, special ed and speech therapy because no one was willing to make exemptions and these are programs designed to help disabled children. if they aren't accommodating, who will be? many disabled people have lost the way they normally travel or get their food or so many other basic things due to covid and masking policies.  as to face shields, most places do not allow them to be worn instead of masks. from your perspective, it might seem easy to just get an accommodation or an exemption but it's not that way at all. there have been numerous stories that i've heard/experienced myself or read about in various disability communities where people were told they wouldn't be served or even had the police called on them for not wearing a mask.   here are some examples:  [https://www.pbmonthly.net/news/story/2020-11-13/parents-say-san-diego-unified-mask-policy-discriminates-against-students-with-disabilities](https://www.pbmonthly.net/news/story/2020-11-13/parents-say-san-diego-unified-mask-policy-discriminates-against-students-with-disabilities)  [https://6abc.com/coronavirus-jenkintown-child-kicked-out-of-boston-market-incident-masks/6242854/](https://6abc.com/coronavirus-jenkintown-child-kicked-out-of-boston-market-incident-masks/6242854/)  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/08/12/southwest-removes-family-flight-after-3-year-old-with-autism-is-unable-wear-mask/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/08/12/southwest-removes-family-flight-after-3-year-old-with-autism-is-unable-wear-mask/) (and many similar stories from other families about being kicked off air travel)  [https://ogletree.com/insights/no-mask-no-service-supermarket-sued-for-disability-discrimination-over-strict-face-covering-policy/](https://ogletree.com/insights/no-mask-no-service-supermarket-sued-for-disability-discrimination-over-strict-face-covering-policy/)  [https://weartv.com/news/local/man-with-disability-claims-discrimination-by-pensacola-businesses-for-not-wearing-mask](https://weartv.com/news/local/man-with-disability-claims-discrimination-by-pensacola-businesses-for-not-wearing-mask)  [https://theconversation.com/mask-exemptions-for-people-with-disabilities-have-not-been-made-clear-and-this-threatens-human-rights-143862](https://theconversation.com/mask-exemptions-for-people-with-disabilities-have-not-been-made-clear-and-this-threatens-human-rights-143862)",1,,-2

315445,"&gt;  &gt; colonel berry had to have remote monitoring for his astronaut patients. for me it may not have been utterly necessary. but it did mean that i was not cluttered with dozens of wires like a fly caught in a web; the microminiaturized sensors were so small and unobtrusive that i never noticed them-yet the nurses had the full picture every minute, every second. &gt;  &gt; another advantage of telemetered remote monitoring is that more than one terminal can display the signals. my wife tells me that there was one at the nursing supervisor's station. dr. chater may have had a terminal in his offices-i don't know. but there can't be any difficulty in remoting a hundred yards or so when the technology was developed for remoting from luna to houston, almost a quarter of a million miles. &gt;  &gt; space spinoff in postoperative care: a doppler ultrasound stethoscope is an impressive example of microminiaturization. it is enormously more sensitive than an acoustic stethoscope; the gain can be controlled, and, because of its doppler nature, fluid flow volume and direction can be inferred by a skilled operator. being ultrasound at extremely high frequency, it is highly directional; an acoustic stethoscope is not. &gt;  &gt; it generates a tight beam of ultrasound beyond the range of the human ear. this beam strikes something and bounces back, causing interference beats in the audible range. it behaves much like doppler radar save that the radiation is ultrasound rather than electromagnetic. thus it is a non invasive way to explore inside the body without the dangers of x-ray . . . and is able to 'see' soft tissues that x-ray can't see. &gt;  &gt; both characteristics make it especially useful for protecting pregnant mothers and unborn babies. i am not departing from the call; babies unborn and newly born, and mothers at term must be classed as 'temporarily but severely handicapped.' &gt;  &gt; doppler ultrasound was used on me before, during, and after surgery. &gt;  &gt; after my convalescence i was again examined by computerized axial tomography. no abnormalities-- other than the new plate in my skull. &gt;  &gt; this brain surgery is not itself a spinoff from space technology . . . but note how repeatedly space spinoffs were used on me before, during, and after surgery. this operation is very touchy; in the whole world only a handful of surgical teams dare attempt it. of the thousand-odd of these operations to date, worldwide, dr. chater has performed more than 300. his mortality rate is far lower than that of any other team anywhere. this is a tribute to his skill but part of it comes from his attitude: he always uses the latest, most sophisticated tools available. &gt;  &gt; i was far gone; i needed every edge possible. several things that tipped the odds in my favor are spinoffs from space technology. &gt;  &gt; was it worthwhile?

668502,"&gt; actually there is nothing done in the brit milah that is even close to child abuse. it is a healthy alternative to leaving the penis uncircumcised.  what you're spreading is fud.  70%-75% of the earth's men are intact. circumcision is rare outside of the u.s., south korea (u.s.-influenced), israel, the muslim world (68% of circumcised men), and the older generations of canada and australia (both of which were influenced by the u.s.). outside of these countries/cultures, 'routine' circumcision is considered bizarre.  ***----history----***  first, you must understand that 'routine' circumcision became prevalent in the united states not for legitimate medical reasons, but for religiously based pseudo-medicine and superstition.  in particular, circumcision was advocated as a way to curb masturbation, because such ""self-abuse"" was regarded as a sin against god and one of the main causes for all manner of physical and mental illness, including blindness and epilepsy.  in fact, one of the [major proponents of circumcision](http://www.circumstitions.com/kellogg.html) in the u.s. stated that one of the bonuses of the amputation is the pain, because it serves as a corporal reminder of the ills of sexual stimulation.  this is of course all rubbish. for instance, studies have shown that circumcised men actually masturbate more frequently than intact men--likely, because of the constant (unwanted) stimulation of their exposed glans and remaining inner foreskin and frenulum. also, circumcised men are more likely to participate in more exotic sexual behavior such as anal sex and fellatio, which is perhaps due to a sensory inbalance that requires a more exotic stimulation of the brain (note, this is not to say that anal sex or fellatio are 'deviant').  nevertheless, once routine amputation of the foreskin became prevalent, the medical establishment sought to associate it with legitimate medical benefits.  ***----hygiene----***  general ease of hygiene was an early stated benefit of circumcision. however, the intact penis requires no special treatment. because the nascent foreskin of children is fused to the glans (even up to late adolescence), children require only external cleaning (in fact, [forced retraction of the foreskin](http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/info/info-forcedretraction.html) is unhealthy and dangerous). in the adult, the foreskin retracts so easily, that rinsing during a shower is not even a conscious effort.  simply put, hygiene is no reason for circumcision; the majority of the earth's men would find this claim laughable.  ***----infections----***  another often listed benefit of circumcision is the prevention of [urinary tract infections (utis)](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/uti); like most pro-circumcision talking points, this notion mainly came as the result of dubious studies. however, infants are at a higher risk for uti in the weeks following circumcision. besides the fact that utis are generally easy to cure and infrequent, the incidence of infection are roughly the same between an intact boy and a circumcised boy. *moreover, the intact adult is less likely to suffer from a uti than a circumcised adult male, likely because the meatus of the circumcised penis is constantly and directly exposed to the environment.*  more to the point, some doctors recommend circumcision in cases of recurrent uti. however, there is no medical evidence to support this recommendation. recurrent utis are associated with congenital abnormalities of the upper urinary tract. indeed, the national kidney and urologic diseases clearinghouse (nkudic), a service of the national institutes of health does not suggest circumcision as a prevention or cure of urinary tract infection.  it is also interesting to consider girls. a recent scandinavian study found that girls and boys have about the same incidence of uti in the first year of life. girls have a four times higher incidence of uti in the first six years of life than non-circumcised boys. no special concern is manifested regarding this much higher rate of infection in girls...  why don't we alter the genitalia of girls?  therefore, circumcision is not a suitable reason to provide for reducing the risk of utis.  ***----stds/hiv----***  very recently, hiv/aids has replaced utis as the scare-tactic for promoting amputation of the foreskin. however, safe sexual practices are not only essential, but they are the only reliable and effective means for controlling and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases; even though the un's recent (u.s.-led) studies suggest that circumcision reduces the incidence of hiv infection, the un still acknowledges that only sex education and sexually responsible behavior (such as using condoms) are effective solutions.  in fact, [this meta-study of those un studies](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120747249/abstract?cretry=1&amp;sretry=0)  suggests that 72 circumcisions are necessary in order to prevent one case of hiv infection. in conclusion, the researches make a half-hearted endorsement of the procedure:  &gt; male circumcision is an effective strategy for reducing new male hiv infections. its impact on a population level will require consistently safe sexual practices to maintain the protective benefit.  to make my point clear, i'll point out that the last sentence states that  *consistently safe sexual practices* are necessary to be protected from hiv.  also, consider [this article](http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news-1/role-of-circumcision-in-reducing-hiv-risk-still-unclear-27082-1/) that states circumcision does not decrease the risk of contracting hiv for gay men. then consider [the following study](http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/meetingabstracts/ma?f=102180172.html) that shows many gay men engage in unsafe sexual practices.  more to the point, the circumcised men in the un studies are muslim. no doubt does this cultural affiliation have an effect on their sexual behavior and would explain why these circumcised men are at a reduced risk of hiv.  therefore, it is obvious that the un studies are hindered by confounding variables and that the real solution to the spread of hiv (and other stds) is not circumcision, but sexually responsible behavior.  furthermore, the u.s. has the highest rate of circumcision among industrialized nations (not considering, say, israel), and yet the u.s. hiv incidence rate is 3.5 times higher than that of the closest advanced industrialized nation.  ***----cancer----***  another claim is that circumcision protects boys from penile cancer. however, penile cancer occurs in *old men* and at an extremely small incidence. the national cancer institute of the u.s. expected a 2008 incidence of 1250 cases. for the u.s., that's rougly:      1250 / 305186613 * 100% = 0.00041%  [wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penile_cancer):  &gt; penile cancer is very rare in europe and north america, occurring in about one in 100,000 men in the latter. it accounts for 0.2% of cancers and 0.1% of deaths from cancer amongst males in the united states.  moreover, it is generally thought that carcinoma of the penis is caused by viruses like hpv and other diseases that result from sexually irresponsible behavior and extremely poor hygiene.  ***----conclusion----***  in short, circumcision is derived from the true but misguided insight that removing a body part prevents problems with that body part. yet, these problems are not inherent in the foreskin; in fact, the foreskin is valuable itself.  just leave your son the way he was born: healthy and whole. be open with him about how his healthy penis is supposed to function and teach him to be sexually safe and clean. set it and forget it.... it's just that easy; most of the world agrees, as has the american academy of pediatrics since 1971; in 1999 the aap strengthened this stance and the ama recognizes that medically unnecessary circumcision has no therapeutic benefit.  edit: taken from mrforeskin's comments",0,,

365561,"&gt; you are assuming that competence is so obvious and unarguable that anyone can distinguish competence at a glance.  no, i'm saying that there are a number of easy indicators that, if present, will make the likelihood of prosecution essentially zero.  you are still talking as if perfection is necessary.  this is not so.  look at the report:  &gt; one such is where vendors are demonstrably negligent in selling products which they know to be insecure, but which they advertise as secure.  if a complaint is made, can you easily determine whether they are demonstrably negligent?  of course not.  that's what the courts are for.  but can you easily look for signs that they have taken security seriously, and thus dismiss the complaint easily in the common case of a competent organisation?  i think so.  are there grey areas?  yes, of course.  but if legislation like this goes ahead, then they won't be the common case.  i don't think competence is obvious and unarguable in *all* cases.  but it's obvious in enough cases that  there won't be lots of spurious prosecutions of organisations that act in good faith.  &gt; the disability discrimination act is nothing like the same thing.  a legal obligation on developers to make reasonable effort to assure a particular aspect of quality?  it's *exactly* the same thing.  &gt; it only affects the user interface  so?  &gt; there is plenty of case law about what constitutes compliance  there's practically no case law whatsoever regarding websites.  the rnib keep taking on cases, and the organisations keep backing down.  i don't think it's ever gone to court.  &gt; aiui you just have to demonstrate that every feature of the site is accessible via text-only browsers  you understand wrong.  it's a *lot* more complex than that.  the law itself doesn't make any reference to specific technology or restrictions, it simply says that you've got to make a reasonable effort not to discriminate.  in practice, so long as organisations make an effort to follow best practices and respond appropriately if they get complaints from disabled people, they aren't liable for anything.  i hope you can see the parallels with a similar responsibility towards security, they are blindly obvious to me.  an organisation takes care of due diligence and is responsive to problems that arise?  then it's safe.  an organisation doesn't do that?  it's going to court just as soon as somebody complains.  &gt; if you want to introduce a new technology or process you won't have anyone asking how to be sure it doesn't violate the dda.  of course you do.  for example, you want to put streaming video on your site?  well what are you going to do about captions for the deaf?  &gt; but if you have liability for ""negligent"" bugs then any new technology or process, even if it is an obvious improvement, is going to be considered guilty until proven innocent: ""yes, {insertfavouritetech} sounds interesting, but what do you have to do to demonstrate due care?"". if you don't have a legally definitive answer then nobody is going take the risk of trying it.  that's a ridiculous attitude to take.  common law *often* doesn't specify things up front, leaving it for the courts to decide the details.  that's one of the defining features of a common law legal system.  yet everybody still gets on with things regardless of not knowing the finer details, because in practice, so long as you *make an effort*, then nobody is going to prosecute you for intentional negligence.  there's no legally definitive answer for what constitutes an accessible website in the uk.  yet uk web developers aren't too scared to go to work in the mornings.  we know that as long as we don't bury our heads in the sand and pretend accessibility can be ignored, then we aren't going to get sued.",0,,

725138,"&gt;my point is that to a large percent of the deaf community they are not ""handicapped.""   you can look at the color orange and swear up and down it's blue but that doesn't make it so. they are human beings. deaf is not a different species or subspecies. while it's great that they don't view themselves as handicapped, the truth is if you are missing 20% of the senses that the vast majority of your species has, you are handicapped by the dictionary definition of the word. there is an extremely specific meaning of the word, it's not meant as a judgement of their worth or anything else, simply of the fact that when compared to 90%+ of the species they come from, they are missing capabilities.  &gt;they may be ""impaired"", but they are fully capable of performing in society.  incorrect. they can only use telephones, for example, because of special devices designed to get around the fact that they are missing one of their 5 senses. likewise they could not enjoy movies or television if companies did not go out of their way to write down nearly every sound for hearing-impaired subtitles. these are just two examples, but hopefully enough to illustrate a point: the only reason deaf folks can be seen as being fully capable of performing in society is because we live in a society that is humane enough to go out of our way and make special exceptions for disabled people. we've even gone so far as to codify this into law. but please don't confuse society making accommodations for people with disabilities with said people being as completely capable as non-disabled folks.  &gt;think about it: you are in a room full of deaf individuals who speak american sign language. they are fully conversant. you are not.  i've thought about it. it's a straw man argument and has absolutely nothing to do with our conversation. the same result would come from any room full of people who speak a language i cannot speak. you know the difference though? i can learn asl and be perfectly conversant with everyone in that room. they can never close their eyes and have a spoken conversation with me though, can they? at least not without a cochlear implant.  finally, i'm not sure who the target audience for the last paragraph was since there wasn't a shred of outrage or anything like it in my comment, i assume it wasn't me; so i'm simply not going to address it.",1,,0

483944,"&gt; true, the act leaves it to the discretion of the municipalities what privileges the permit provides. &gt;&gt; so there is no reason that toronto has to provide these permits.  no, there are _plenty_ of reasons to provide the permits. that's like saying there's no reason toronto provides recycling collection services, or pothole filling services, or tree cutting services, or 311 services, or road cleaning services, or animal control services, or a hundred other services. toronto isn't _required_ to do these things, but there are _reasons_ why they do them and why they _should_ do them.    &gt; that said, in toronto, the permit does not allow them to park ""anywhere"". pretty much only where it's ""no parking"" all-day. &gt;&gt; there are good reasons why such areas are deemed no parking. just because you are in some way disabled shouldn't give you cause to work against the reasons.  indeed, but these reasons aren't critical. ""no parking"" still allows for people to _stop_ and/or _stand_ to load/unload passengers or merchandise. (""no standing"" is for passengers only, not merchandise) so as long as it's not a timed ""no parking"" (e.g., for rush hour, snow plowing) it's still considered safe to stop there and generally speaking, deemed that the world won't come crashing down if someone does.  &gt; regards to ""free"" it's only for on-street paid parking. and this is to help offset the fact that people who use them need to park close to their destination and don't have an option to park further away for cheaper/free.  &gt;&gt; why do they need to park closer? most people with a disability who are able to operate a motor vehicle can move some distance.  parking ""closer"" might mean the difference of a few meters and a hundred meters. yes, they can move _some distance_, but that distance may be limited or deemed a hardship that we, as a society, generally feel that they shouldn't need to have if we can easily alleviate it. _many_ people who use them can still operate a car: respiratory ailments (yes, people can lose their breath just from walking 10 metres) and extreme pain in the legs are just two.  furthermore, not all of them do drive. frequently non-disabled persons drive those with disabilities and they cannot simply ""load/unload"" them, but must actually _leave_ the car to assist them into/out-of the building for several minutes. this would be grounds for a ticket to leave the car for an extended period. or if you arrive at a destination to pick someone up with the disability and are waiting for 5 minutes for them, this is also grounds for a ticket. the permit and these privileges allow people with disabilities to lead more independent lives. (imagine instead it was, ""hi, sorry, the closest parking spot i could find was two blocks that way, let me help you out of the building, and you can wait here by the street for 10 minutes in the {insert lovely toronto weather here} while i get the car and come around to pick you up."")  &gt; or given that meters have maximum time limits, makes it so they don't have to make arduous trips back to the meter several times a day. &gt;&gt; i have never done this. also, i believe that you are not supposed to do this. you can be ticketed if you leave your car in one spot past the usual maximum 3 hours. why do these people get to stay put when everyone else has to move?  yes, exactly, there is a 3 hour maximum limit _except_ for people with the permit. this is to acknowledge the fact that these people may be commuting for work, or medical appointments, or really _anything_. for people without disabilities, they can go refill the meter (and hope they don't get ticketed for that) or go find another parking spot. we, as a city, decided that there's good enough reason for people with disabilities to not have to do this. great that you have never done this, therefore nobody else needs to?  &gt; (try that in inches of snow in a manual wheelchair, walker, or blind with 2 feet tall snow drifts) hell, sometimes with bad snow days it's physically impossible for some people to even reach the meters to pay. &gt;&gt; any weather that bad and they can take a cab.  except for all the reasons they can't take a cab (for _example_, transporting infants in car seats, having other belongings in cars, among other reasons) this isn't necessarily an option. and it doesn't stop the fact that weather comes and goes. can be clear in the morning coming into work, and 10 centimetres by the afternoon. in municipalities that _do_ have a taxi credit system, some (all?) require that you book a day (or more) in advance for accessible taxis; weather is not predictable enough to book a cab 24-48 hours in advance. speaking of which, there's something to be said for allowing someone the ability to drive (or be driven) somewhere on a whim (e.g., ""hey bob, we're all going to see a movie tonight, want to come?"" ""no, sorry steve, i can't because i have to book an accessible cab a day in advance and i won't be allowed to park my minivan in front of the theatre in this crazy weather."")  &gt; firstly, the cab industry is woefully lacking in accessible cabs. &gt;&gt; most of these permits - when legitimate - are for people with regular cars.  so... because only a minority of _legitimate_ users require modified vehicles, then they should be screwed over because they aren't the majority? or are you saying this is a non-issue because since they are a minority, the existing taxi system is sufficient? if the latter, this is not the case: if you require an accessible cab in the city, you usually need to book the trip in advance.    &gt; some people use their cars multiple times a day and carry their personal goods in them, make long trips in/out of town, or have relatives/friends with them doing whatever (or they're travelling in a friend's vehicle). &gt;&gt; a lot of able bodied people can't afford a car to do such things. remember - these disabled people can find paid parking like the rest of us.  uhh what? unless i'm completely misunderstanding your point, if someone can't afford a car and don't drive, then it's _irrelevant_ to the discussion. i'm not even sure what you're trying to say in your second sentence about ""can find paid parking like the rest of us"".  &gt;&gt; for some reason many people have an idea ""oh, they have a disability, we should give them a pass to park for free."" that's crazy.   yet a person without a disability can _choose_ to park a 5 minute walk away from their destination for cheaper/free, or _choose_ to take transit to their destination. for a person with a disability, they may not even have that _choice._  another case is when an assisstive person is helping someone into or out of their destination. if i'm driving a friend with a disability somewhere, but they need a hand inside the building i would have to pay the minimum half-hour of parking whereas if they were able-bodied, i could just unload them and drive off.  furthermore, it serves as an _incentive_ for people with disabilities to take their own (or a relative's) car rather than take a _far more expensive_ taxi or wheeltrans which are many, many times more expensive to the taxpayer.  &gt;&gt; if anything they should be thankful for the wheelchair parking spots which are in many places, almost always free despite the plague of parking passes.  the ""free"" aspect only applies to metered _on street_ parking. while there are more on street handicap spots becoming available, they are still relatively few and far between. they are also usually provided because the venue nearby doesn't have a private parking lot and would often receive persons with disabilities; without a dedicated handicap-only spot, all nearby spots would be filled by drivers who are not handicapped.  &gt;&gt; if anything they should be thankful for...  &gt;&gt; have a disability and don't want to be discriminated against in a job selection? great! but don't extend it to giving people perks to drive.  this is extremely condescending. it's not about providing ""perks"". it's about providing an equitable system whereby people with disabilities can, generally speaking, live out an independent life and, ideally, not be a significant (or any) drain on the system. minor ""perks"" like these incentivizes people to not use wheeltrans or taxi services. if you have an issue with them being able to park ""for free"" and the lost cost associated with that, consider how much more it would cost to have the city reimbursing for taxis or subsidizing wheeltrans much more often instead.  so, what exactly are we discussing here?   are we discussing that there's too much _illegitimate_ users abusing the system? if so, great, i'm with you on that. let's fix the system (more enforcement? more regulation/checking for doctors? better anti-counterfeiting measures?) and not screw legitimate users in the process.  or are we discussing that people who _legitimately_ use the disabled parking permit have these ""perks""? that it's ""crazy"" and ""these disabled people can find paid parking like the rest of us""? if so, then i think we haven't anything else to discuss because your arguments hold no water, you are ill-informed about the issues, and i doubt anything i could say would change that. i don't blame you for that; many of these issues are fairly nuanced, difficult to conceive, and the solutions to them are often counter-intuitive.",1,,2

688731,"&gt; wherever the arbitrary line is drawn when determining which conditions/illnesses/afflictions are permitted to join the paralympics, that will determine the result. because of this, fairness is a meaningless concept at the paralympics.  i agree with that, but it just so happens that there are a limited number of conditions that a person can realistically have. there are an infinite number of illnesses that a human can get, but almost everyone ends up dying of just a handful of them. 75% of americans die of heart disease, cancer, and accidents, and about 95% die of just 10 types of illness.  in the same way, there are a ton of disabilities a person could potentially develop, but realistically there are just a few that most people get. because most competitors have largely the same problems, it ends up averaging out to be the same.  furthermore, disabilities are not classified by disease, but by the specific limitation they have. it might not seem fair for a person who was in an accident to go up against someone with cancer or a congenital birth defect, but all three of them might have the same problem. they all had amputations above the knee. the focus on the specific handicap they have, which makes it more even. it would not be fair to put a person with bone cancer and an above the knee amputation against a person with a below the knee amputation, so they avoid doing that. (a person with a below the knee amputation can bend their knee, but a person with an above the knee amputation can only swing a rigid leg from the hip.)  the same thing can be said for neurological illnesses. it's not about how people with ms, brain injury, and cerebral palsy have different conditions. it's about how these specific nerves are damaged and these specific limitations are present (whether it's hypertonia aka inability to stretch, ataxia aka balance problems, and/or athetosis aka a writing movement and inability to maintain a steady posture.)  ultimately, the line isn't arbitrary. there are a limited number of conditions that people can have, and physicians and scientists have long done research on what those conditions are and how much they impact a person's performance.   &gt; consider a swimming race. someone who was born without legs (that is, practically nothing below the torso) is clearly disabled in a way that affects their ability to swim, and therefore their ability to compete in the olympics.  there are 10 different categories that the ipc uses. this would fall under the category of limb deficiency.   &gt; what about someone who was born with fully-formed legs that don't work at all. also a disability, but not equivalent.  this would fall under the category of impaired muscle power.  &gt; what about someone who was born with legs that are 20% the length of 'normal' legs? 30%? 50%? 75%?  this would fall under the category of leg length difference.  the point is that there are a lot of different classes and sports, and people with different levels of impairment are put into different categories. you are right that if a category is 13 and under, then all the winners would be 12. but if you make the categories of 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, then it's a lot more fair. that's how the paralympics avoids this issue. they have more categories. the 11 year olds are still going to be worse than the 12 year olds, but it's more fair than it would be otherwise.  also don't forget that the paralympics are different from the special olympics. the special olympics is for intellectual disabilities, and doesn't turn away participants. it's much more about personal achievement. the paralympics is for a handful of clear physical disabilities. they turn away people who don't meet the disability requirements or are not well trained enough to compete. it's much more about elite performance. some people might miss out on the opportunity to compete, but the people who do get to compete do have largely the same limitation.",1,,0
609011,"i just want to say thank you for your reply. i do appreciate hearing the other side of things, even if i intensely disagree.  i am familiar with some of the fundamental notions of what is termed 'deaf culture'. but i find it to be an over-sentimental attachment to a condition that obviously disadvantages those who have it.   so called 'oralism' isn't really comparable to racism as you might suggest. it's not a case of judging and hating deaf people for their condition; it's being fundamentally unable to communicate with them.   having a cochlear implant doesn't mean that someone can't still communicate in sign language with those who don't have one. and if it means they are to be a pariah and cast out, then it strikes me that deaf culture is intensely insular and exclusionary. it also seems to hold itself apart as being some special state - would a newly blind member of the deaf community be shunned or condemned for choosing to have a cochlear implant and regain one of their senses? in its own way deaf culture strikes me as intensely ableist and discriminatory, coming from the perspective that only one particular combination of disabilities is somehow special.  using the analogy of a different language is also misleading - anyone can learn to sign, and no one has ever suggested that this not be encouraged. it ignores that this 'language' stems from failure to be able to communicate with others through normal means. clinging to one language out of sentimentality ignores the purpose of language in the first place - to communicate. to suggest that speakers of any single language must shun those who are bilingual or discourage such cross-cultural understanding again strikes me as repugnant.   i also feel that comparisons with sexual orientation, and the plight of lgbt people, are fairly spurious. this isn't the case of allowing people to make their own decisions and encouraging them to be free and able to live life to the full. this is, if anything, the opposite. it's far closer to straight, fanatically religious parents raising their kids in their faith and telling them that it's not right to be gay, and that they can't live their lives. the inescapable impact on the social, economic and educational opportunities of those in the deaf community effectively works entirely against the progress achieved by civil rights movements, encouraging people to accept hardship and isolation within an insular community.   as for saying that hearing is better - well, it is. ignoring the reality of a disability doesn't make it go away. disabled people can't hear. we wouldn't even be considering the idea that some horribly brain damaged or paralysed child was as well off than their able-bodied and healthy peers. we wouldn't say that they 'just had a different way of moving'. we might accommodate those who were autistic, or had other neurological conditions, but even then only those who were extremely high functioning. i suppose it might be true that you can't miss what you've never had, but all that does is make you ignorant of your disadvantage. no one would ever seriously say that someone born into the world of 1984 and worshipping big brother was better off simply because they were content and couldn't envisage a liberal democratic society.   i'm sorry if i seem aggressive - i understand that these aren't necessarily your viewpoints, but i find the notion that disability should be preserved to be incredibly harmful and blinkered, whether or not it's well-intentioned. if i've seemed rude at all then i'm also very sorry - that's really not my intention.",1,,-1
551802,"my younger brother has cerebral palsy (he's 14) and i did a year-long internship on cp in high school. the only decent news i can tell you is that cerebral palsy is an umbrella term. it encompasses a lot of different motor disabilities. my brother, for instance, is a spastic quadriplegic (different doctors describe him differently though...). he is and will always be in a wheelchair. however, your daughter sounds very young, and though i obviously don't know the specifics, you really won't know how severe her cp is until later. it's also possible it's a false diagnosis- cp gets commonly diagnosed for minor motor developmental issues. it's unfortunate that cp comes with brain damage. it can happen at birth or after a traumatic incident at a very young age, and obviously with brain damage other complications can come hand in hand, but that **isn't** always the case. my brother's cognitive abilities are completely undamaged. he's just nonverbal and has to use a communication device, called a vantage. he's a bright, young individual. as for quality of life, it's not always easy. financially, the strain is definitely there. medicaid is his primary health insurance because of his disability but they're always being cheap asses. at the beginning of this year- as a perfectly annoying example- they stopped covering compounded medications (baclofen in his case) at nearly every pharmacy we've ever used. also, when he entered middle school, the school district here in the lovely state of north carolina challenged his- colin's- position in a normal classroom. my mother tried with all her might to fight it, but a psychologist came in to *evaluate* him, and when i say i evaluate i mean she walked in the room, didn't acknowledge his existence, and never looked at him. she had made up her mind before even meeting him. fucking bitch. excuse me. anyways, she deemed him ""cognitively impaired"" and he was transferred to a special education classroom. he will never get a high school diploma. that has probably been the hardest thing on my family. being told he is mentally retarded when we can clearly tell he isn't. there isn't a thing we can do about it either, the county school system is such a joke and handles nothing professionally. he's behind in school because from kindergarten to 3rd grade his teachers would speak louder and slower if he didn't answer right away, and he would sit there laughing at their stupidity, which they must have taken for deftness. also, using his vantage via a head-stick takes him 10x longer to write something than it would for another child to simply say it. the fatigue wears on him when his most useful muscles are the ones in his neck, which at that aren't very strong. i know this isn't a very positive story but i'm just trying to convey that it isn't going to be easy. colin, even being in a special ed classroom where he doesn't belong, is the happiest kid i've ever met. he loves the food network and playing video games. he has a pet chinchilla that he would die for. all i can say is you *have* to be there for her. it's essential that you're strong. you're her support system, her guardian, everything. i wish nothing for the best for you. it sounds scary now but i'm sure it will all work out in the end for you and your family.",1,,2

811616,"i'm not against screening. i'm not chucking it all in the same bin   i am saying that we should not do that.   that just because a child has a disability does not mean they are better off dead and not being born.  that parents should choose for themselves.  that it is ok to choose to terminate and it is ok to choose to go to term.  that we should not assume and that we should support them whatever their choice and remember it is their choice.   **a few more things:** (mostly because i am procrastinating.)  your statement comparing down's syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. what you have written is missing a word or some letters to make it clear what you mean, but you seem to mean asd is easier to cope with as an individual and a parent. some people with ds are able to live more independently as adults relative to asd individuals. however the opposite can also be true. i would posit that this is an example of chucking everyone with ds or asd in the same bin. i use these words as they are yours. many disabilities are heterogeneous in how they present how individuals can function.   &gt;screening for severe [p]hysical/mental disabilities is because people are poor, incapable of caring for such child or because some disabilities are really debilitating to the point of suffering for everyone. yes, on some disabilities lead to suffering for everyone. i have agreed with this many times before you posted this comment. sometimes it makes suffering for society (perceived) more than the actual individual. this doesn't mean they do not have the right to exist if their parents choose to go to term. did you miss what i was arguing against though? forcing people to abort, or automatically assuming people severe and/or profound disabilities have no value. am i advocating for suffering? no. i'm saying having a severe and/or profound disability does make you any less of a human, inherently equal, deserving of both dignity and respect.   i have not said we should not screen for things, or that parents should be forced to have children they do not want, because of disability or any other reason. we should also not force people to abort because of a disability. there will obviously be circumstances the foetus is not viable or compatible with life, will live for a short period after birth in excruciating pain or will live for a long time still in excruciating pain. the decision of how to proceed here is not up to me, or you, nor should it be subject to popular vote. parents, medical professionals, and sometimes the courts will need to decide.  here's something from andrew solomon's book on that idea you mentioned about whether you can have a kid depending on socioeconomic status.  ""people of higher socioeconomic status tend towards perfectionism, and have a harder time living with perceived defects. one french study said baldly, ""the lower classes show a higher tolerance for severely handicapped children."""" telling parents they cannot have a child that has tested positive for a disability or condition that is expensive but not necessarily severely debilitating because they cannot afford the required and associated healthcare costs is another kind of messed up, not to mention discriminatory.  (for example, a friend of mine had a child who was born with their heart valves back to front, upside down, and crossed incorrectly. a shit storm. they would have been advised to abort had it been caught a few weeks earlier. in another country without universal healthcare, they would never have been able to afford to save this kids life. but this kid was saved with surgery after surgery, and eventually a hearth transplant. this kid still goes to the hospital every few weeks as she is older now, has regular surgery to check for rejection etc and it is expensive. these folks could not afford this if they were in a country where they had to pay. this kid is at school and living the life now. if they had aborted that's cool that's their choice. if they were forced to abort because they were deemed to poor to afford to have their child live... that would be awful.)   &gt;screening for homosexuality is because people are judgemental idiots. i love that you mention this. as if the gays are listed simply because people are judgmental idiots, yet the disabilities are up for discussion because that's a real debate and has nothing to do with being judgmental.  here's more from solomon for this one, on telling individuals and families about how the book was being put together and who was involved.  ""deaf people didn't want to be compared to people with schizophrenia; some parents of schizophrenics were creeped out by dwarfs. the prodigies and their families objected to being in a book with the severely disabled. some children of rape felt that their emotional struggle was trivialised when they were compared to gay activists.""  a lot of the reactions to this topic seem judgmental, and/or emotionally charged. i'm finding it strange, as i am advocating for the complete opposite. i'm not judging those that abort or do not, screen or do not, accept their children and are able to give them everything they need and everything they can, or those that cannot.  in solomon's book there are fascinating and painful interviews as well with parents who have children who have special needs and then are unable to do what society 'expects' of them. a woman fromwho, after a terrible period of indecision, gives her mentally and physically disabled child up for adoption; the mother of two severely autistic children, who, when her husband asks, ""would you marry me again?"", replies, ""yeah, but not with the kids."" she adds, ""do i love my kids? yes. will i do everything for them? yes."" but, ""i wouldn't do it again. i think anybody who tells you they would is lying.""  i want to say i am not judging those who have been using words in this thread such as ""r----d"" and ""s-----c"" etc, but i think i am. i am judging their use of language, the offensiveness displayed in the use of those words. i am fearful for the people needing assistance who are called these things by the people responsible for caring for them. our words demonstrate our feelings. these words show anger. i have seen first hand how some vulnerable people end up being treated by people who use these names. it's not nice. it's not fair. it is not the fault of those that are vulnerable.   i'm saddened in some cases by what i think is misplaced anger from siblings, extended family carers, and of course parents that end up with more than they ever imagined and are absolutely at their wits end. this struggle leads to this language use for some. they have no support. the government won't help. the community won't help. they are stuck. it is not the fault of the person with a disability. please note it is also not the fault of the parents etc. no one is at fault. nor should they have to suck up the difficulties and be stuck in what, for some, is absolute hell.   here's where i believe our anger should be aimed. community services need more funding and support. families should not have to fight for help. we should all be angry. i think we are just not angry at the right people yet. we should expect and demand support for those that need it. the people that need it, that we are talking about, are deserving of dignity, respect, decent care, compassion, amongst many other things. we should all be providing it through public services that we pay for with taxes.",1,,0
835612,"eh, i think it's all semantics. i'm legally considered disabled (get special considerations in school as long as i fill out the proper forms) and am covered under the american's with disabilities act so the school can not deny me those considerations.   if i have to self-identify, i prefer ""disabled"" as i think it is a more encompassing term. i tend to associate handicapped with amputees and other overtly physical disabilities that would directly restrict a person's movement, while to me ""disabled"" encompasses everything from amputee to seizures to mental health issues. maybe it's because ""disability/disabled"" is the general legal term?   but i'm not an amputee, nor do i have some other ""visible"" or even constant illness. i have chronic migraines so most days i'm fine but 1-2 times a week i get a ""regular"" migraine and about once every month or two i get a nasty, multi-day, brain-buster that my regular painkillers can't touch and leaves me pretty much incapable of doing anything until the ""good"" pain-killers kick in and i'm out cold.   but it isn't something that directly affects me 24/7 (like being blind might), nor can you tell i have a disability by looking at me. i doubt anyone would consider me ""handicapped"" or ""disabled"" unless i pointed it out to them.",1,,0

""cripple"" is for good-natured joking only. and i make several deadpan jokes about my disability using really blunt language, so i don't mind that much either.  phrases i object (when directed towards me): ""gimp,"" ""special needs,"" ""wheelchair-bound,"" ""confined to wheelchair,"" and likely more i'm forgetting.",1,,1

121648,"hey!  i get your point.  unfortunately i think you either responded to the wrong topic or got confused - this post was about tight rulesets, not about balance, but you seem to use those interchangably.  you can make tight rules with an unbalanced system, or a balanced system with not tight rules.  if it was about balance, well, warmachine/hordes is one system that supports 14 full factions, and warhammer 40k has 18 (really about 16 if you dont include some armies that are meant to be allies and not full factions).  fantasy doesn't have to be balanced against 40k so it's not included.  so the difference isn't so great.  unless you think the jump from 14 to 16-18 factions really breaks the camels back there, but i cant see it.     but back to the tight ruleset -  warhammer 40k's main rules problem isn't the vast number of rules.  it's not the minute rules interactions.  really the core problem is the rules aren't written in a systematic fashion.  a systematic rule set lays down terms and uses them to create a complete and bounded system.  40k has decided not to go this route and elects not to fully define terms most of the time, and often uses many similar terms with slight differences to mean the same thing, leading to confusion.  40k rules are written when the rules writer has an idea in mind and jots down what he thought in plain english.  most games with tight rulesets has the creator think of a rule, then they write it down in the confines of the rules set.  to use an example earlier today - ""a single passenger can fire out of each fire point"".  this is a poor rule as it stands, because the timing is not defined, and 40k doesn't even have a definition for what firing means.  do you ""fire"" psychic shooting attacks?  are you firing once or twice if you shoot two shots from the same weapon?  are you firing twice if you shoot two different weapons?  a tighter defined rules set would have defined ""fire"" as making a ranged attack, and ranged attacks as psychic, shooting, etc.  it would let you know if that is per phase or per turn or per firing step or what the timing is.  to use an example from a comprehensive ruleset, in magic there's a card that makes all blue lands produce an extra mana.  in 40k it might very well be a psychic power that reads ""all blue lands produce an extra mana"".    that would be a terrible rule.  produce is not defined, it doesn't say when they make the extra mana (when they produce, do they produce two?  do they produce one now and one at the normal time?).  theres just a lot of problems with that wording, you know this without even playtesting it.  thats why magic words it ""until end of turn, whenever a player taps an island for mana, that player adds blue to his or her mana pool""   the timing is defined, tap is a defined term in the rules, everything about the rule uses defined terms and fits perfectly into the ruleset.  just reading through different games' rulesets, you can instantly tell by their format and terminology if they were designed to be a comprehensive system or a just descriptions of different things the author envisioned. 40k reads like someone explaining the game to a friend, not a set of comprehensive rules you can make a complete system from.  it's not the minor interactions that come from having so many rules, it's the way they are written.",0,,

836853,"this question shows several fundamental misunderstandings about how language, identity, and disability works.  in sum; yes. you don't need our permission to consider yourself disabled. you don't need a specific diagnosis to consider yourself disabled. as i see it, disabled is the best word to describe who you are.   disability means your body is physically limited in contrast with an ablebodied person in similar condition. it doesn't necessarily mean you're wheelchair bound, or entirely unable to use body parts, or completely lack functions. it simply means you aren't able bodied. for grey areas like simply needing glasses, hearing aids, or a cane to function; 'impaired' would be a better term. but impairment is just a milder form of disability, just as infirmity is a more severe form.  i prefer blunt, clinical language like 'impaired', 'disabled', and 'infirm' because it's direct and honest. terms like 'handicapped', 'differently abled', 'special needs' etc. have this air of condescension to them, and disguise the reality that we're not physically or mentally capable of some things. i wish there were a single word that could sum up that, ""we're not completely helpless and infantile, but we also deserve accommodations and human decency."" but there isn't. so we have to be self-advocates and educators.  if you don't want to use the word 'disabled' because you're afraid of the stigma attached, i understand. it can be exhausting to have to constantly fight misconceptions.",1,,1
386460,"&gt;comparing using the word ""retarded"" to using ""blind"" or ""deaf"" to describe people is a flawed connection. when you think of a blind person, you think literally ""someone who can't see.""  there is a range of ""blind"" from people who have trouble seeing to people who literally lack eyeballs.  however, they are all at a disadvantage or are disabled when compared to a ""normal"" person (ie a person who is not limited in their ability to see).  a person who is deaf is limited in that they do not have the capacity to hear that a ""normal"" person has.  a person without legs is limited in that they do not have the capacity to walk or jump that a ""normal"" person has.  no one is claiming that any of these people are incapable of living lives that they find enjoyable.  however, no matter what their experience is, it will never be the same as that of a normal person.   ray charles had a very successful career.  he, however, could not see.  in the case of retardation, we are talking about a persons ability to think.  someone could be mildly retarder or severely retarded.  either way, they do not have the same mental capacity of a ""normal"" person.  pretending otherwise does these people a disservice and, on it's face, is clearly incorrect.  no one is saying that this person is not human.  no one is saying that they can't live a happy life.  hell, i'm sure there are mentally retarded people who've managed to be more financially successful than a certain percentage of the population.  however these people are clearly at a disadvantage.  we sugar coat it all we want, it won't change the facts.  people can be offended by ""retarded"" and desire ""mentally handicapped"" but then that will offend people and it will be ""learning disabled"" or ""cognitively challenged"" or some acronym.   all that is meaningless.  blind is blind.  we don't need to call them ""sightless americans"" or ""optically restricted individuals"" or ""visually challenged"" (which sounds like it means ugly).  retarded is retarded.",1,,1

 as a mod from r/foodforthought testifies:  i was raised by a 30-year special educator, i have a deaf mother-in-law, sister with ms, and a brother who was born disabled. none vision-impaired, but a range of other disabilities which makes it clear that corporations are all too happy to cut deals (and corners) with the cheapest/most profitable option, slap a ""handicap accessible"" label on it, and ignore the fact that their so-called ""accessible"" solution puts the onus on disabled individuals to struggle through poorly designed layouts, misleading marketing, and baffling management choices. to say it's exhausting and humiliating to struggle through a world that able-bodied people take for granted is putting it lightly.  reddit apparently forgot that blind people exist, https://www.reddit.com/r/blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/ and forgot that reddit's official app (which has had over 9 years of development) and yet, when it comes to accessibility for vision-impaired users, reddit‚Äôs own platforms are inconsistent and unreliable. ranging from poor but tolerable for the average user and mods doing basic maintenance tasks (android) to almost unusable in general (ios). didn't reddit whitelist some ""accessibility apps?""  the ceo of reddit announced that they would be allowing some ""accessible"" apps free api usage: redreader, dystopia, and luna.  there's just one glaring problem: redreader, dystopia, and luna* apps have very basic functionality for vision-impaired users (text-to-voice, magnification, posting, and commenting) but none of them have full moderator functionality, which effectively means that subreddits built for vision-impaired users can't be managed entirely by vision-impaired moderators. https://www.reddit.com/r/blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/  (if that doesn't sound so bad to you, imagine if your favorite hobby subreddit had a mod team that never engaged with that hobby, did not know the terminology for that hobby, and could not participate in that hobby -- because if they participated in that hobby, they could no longer be a moderator.)  then reddit tried to smooth things over with the moderators of r/blind. the results were... messy and unsatisfying, to say the least.  https://www.reddit.com/r/blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/  *special shoutout to luna, which appears to be hustling to incorporate features that will make modding easier but will likely not have those features up and running by the july 1st deadline, when the very disability-friendly apollo app, rif, etc. will cease operations. we see what luna is doing and we appreciate you, but a multimillion dollar company should not have have dumped all of their accessibility problems on what appears to be a one-man mobile app developer. redreader and dystopia have not made any apparent efforts to engage with the r/blind community.  thank you for your time & your patience.  i wish you only good things and hope to see you in the used book store, what do you recommend reading or what have you enjoyed lately?",1,,2

&lt;:-)  no. for a start, women aren't a minority, but i'm concerned about their oppression. the reason we're concerned is because they're oppressed, not because they're a minority.  &gt; elsewhere in these discussions the idea was floated that - to a disabled person - someone standing up could be offensive, as it rubs in their face something they're incapable of doing. the ""obvious, enlightened"" remedy for this is for everyone to sit down all the time when paraplegic people are around, and to excise terms like ""run"", ""walk"" and ""jump"" from our vocabularies in favour of the safer, less-oppressive ""move"" (...but then that could offend quadriplegic people, and so on)... but anyone who suggested this would generally be laughed off.  well, firstly, you're using ""offence"" again, repeatedly. secondly, as far as i can tell, that ""obvious, enlightened remedy"" is a strawman, because i don't know anybody who's suggested such a thing ‚Äî perhaps because we're concerned with oppression, not offence. my walking in the presence of a person who can't walk does not oppress them.  &gt; excising all movement-based words from our vocabularies would make everyday speech (oops, offended mute people) practically impossible... and likewise if we excised all complicated or obscure words (so as to avoid oppressing unintelligent people, people with a poor educational level or people with educational difficulties) and similar efforts we'd end up with a horrifyingly imprecise, inexpressive language that was practically useless for actually communicating in.  more strawmen. i don't care about avoiding offence. i go out of my way to offend people sometimes.  &gt;the problem here is that (while i agree it's good to be careful and considerate in your speech), when once you start banning terms (and even actions - ultimately, what's the difference?) because they might oppress groups, you can easily find yourself sliding into a harrison bergeron-style dystopia, where you don't only get rid of inexcusable oppression, but also excellence, originality and genius as well. moreover, there's no clear dividing line at any stage separating here and there. conversely, if you permit ""oppressive"" speech but (for example) allow the community to disapprove of it (eg, by using downvotes or critical replies instead of bans), you also permit the community to decide by consensus if/when it's going too far.  the problem here is tyranny of the majority. most people don't realise that ""lame"", for example could be considered oppressive. the same goes for a lot of homophobic and misogynist language. the problem is exacerbated on reddit (and much of the internet) because of the (self-reinforcing) preponderance of young white males. but the fact that they don't realise that it's a problem doesn't reduce the harm that it causes; they may not even intend to cause harm, but ignorance of the harm doesn't change the fact that harm is caused ([intent is magic!](http://genderbitch.wordpress.com/2010/01/23/intent-its-fucking-magic/)).  the problem then reinforces itself, because the unchecked use of oppressive language will tend to drive away people in marginalised groups, which means fewer people to downvote problematic comments, which drives more people away.  &gt; moreover, you don't necessarily stifle debate (as you do when a comment is removed because of one word) - debate can still continue, but you create a gentle but persistent social pressure to be more considerate with language and thought. unilateral action and use of authoritarian power infringes on autonomy and liberty, which is arguably against the very foundations of anarchism (whichever flavour you subscribe to ;-), but decentralised, democratic persuasion leaves everyone with maximal choice in every instance, and can still achieve many of the same effects without many of the same attendant dangers.  i don't think that anybody's liberty is being infringed on. nobody has the right to cause harm to others, even in an anarchist society (unless doing so will prevent further harm). so, if nobody has the right to harm others, we can't take it away by preventing them from harming others. if i try to stab someone, and you stop me, are you infringing on my autonomy and liberty?  &gt;  finally, if the community decides that - on balance - it's doesn't want to disapprove of every word some people deem oppressive, that's also its democratic right. there's nothing wrong with setting up (for example) a specialist ""moderated_anarchism"" subreddit... but if the majority of all anarchists on reddit (the ""natural constituency"" for r/anarchism) don't want to conform to a relatively draconian aop, should the mods morally force it upon them?  well, i wasn't around when the aop was introduced, but as far as i know it was introduced democratically, and it's not like there aren't long-established unmoderated anarchist-related subreddits, and it's not like there's anything forcing anyone to use this one rather than any of the others.  the thing is that as far as i can tell, the majority of anarchists on reddit simply don't care one way or another. there are 18,000 subscribers, but nowhere near that number are actually involved in the debate on either side, and i suspect they wouldn't notice one way or the other.  besides that is the issue of the tyranny of the majority again; to use an extreme example, if the majority of users wanted to kill all the jews, would it be moral of us to stop them doing so?",1,,1

655800,"i know you're heartbroken now, but the most important thing you need to do is take a step back and think about the diagnosis not as devastating, but just another challenge life has thrown. as with any challenge, there are different paths to take, and you can make the best out of any situation.  i'm a music education major with a minor in psychology (centered around the study of disability and learning). that doctor is completely and totally wrong when she said that your beautiful daughter wouldn't be able to play an instrument. she might not be playing with the bso any time soon, but music comes from the heart and mind. i know you must know the true bliss and meaning of music, seeing as you're a musician yourself...  motor control is the main issue in cp, yes, playing an instrument will be difficult but not impossible. get her enrolled in private study. find a music therapy specialist nearby to help her with using music as an expression and coping mechanism. sing to her. give her a small drum or tambourine to play along with you. there are many simple options that will be highly beneficial to her. take her to a local community music program - i'm sure they would love to work with her.   music is completely natural, and despite her disorder she will want to join in. get her ear interested. teach her theory, and possibly point her more into the direction of composing/arranging. you never know, she could have an ear for composition...which doesn't require motor coordination :) modern notation software is extremely simple and requires but a few clicks and buttons. furthermore...who needs instruments? your body posses one of the most beautiful and unique instruments there is...the voice. :) now, classical voice requires a lot more muscle control than most realize, but the beauty in singing is that you do not have to do all these things right to produce a sound. you can always sing. (though as a voice teacher i encourage healthy singing because serious damage can be done! please be very careful about this, as laryngeal control is a problem in cp and puts her at risk of damaging her voice if she's singing too harshly too much, which could get in the way of communication in general) she could even rap if she wants. i encourage as much(safe) singing as possible to strengthen her voice and ear. beethoven was deaf. ray charles is blind. there's that famous one-armed drummer. there's a trombone major in my school with a severely deformed right hand. one of my good friends has tourrettes. i know numerous music majors with pretty noticeable autism. a lack of motor control does not by any means signify the inability to make beautiful music, or music that makes her feel comfortable with expressing herself. do not focus on what she cannot do, but what she can do. encourage her as much as possible to sit at the piano with you. it will be slow, but practicing her muscular coordination to such a technical degree as piano would require is probably good for her from a therapeutic and exercise point of view. (she will need breaks, however, and will not be able to endure the same long periods of practice time ""normal"" musicians can). there are many many many orf style instruments that are extremely simple that are looked to for early childhood/disability education. never say never; anything is possible.   on a disabilities end, the only message i have for you is to advocate. your daughter is a beautiful, unique human being, however she is being faced with a tough life ahead of her. she will need you. and you will need others - you cannot do this alone. i must stress this. you will go crazy if you do not also develop a support system, and is one of the most common problems with parents with a disabled child. they get so wrapped up with their child that they truly forget about themselves. advocate for her health, education, and well-being, but also advocate for your family (and yourself) as a whole. you should reach out to as many support systems as possible - do not become a reserved family, hiding from society. i know it will be hard. i know every single thing you do involving her will be different from most other people. i know people will sometimes unfairly judge her. but you are her biggest support, and she needs you. don't ever back down. make sure she gets the best education, the most safe musical exposure possible, and sees her disability as simply a disability - not labeling herself as the disorder itself. she is suffering with it...she is much more than her disorder. many find that having a child with a disability teaches inspiring life lessons and principles that other individuals don't get to experience.   i wish you both luck, and a happy, long, musical life together. :) remember - she is beautiful, and much more than her disability.",1,,2

769307,"&gt; i feel like the lions share of education money is spent on below average/""special needs"" children. &gt; but is it, or is that just a feeling you have?  it is. the average student to teacher ratio in the us is between 15 - 16:1, whereas the average ratio for special needs children is 6:1, and if you include the assistant or two that often comes with those teachers it becomes lower, while on the flip side a district potentially would have 1 - 2 gifted and talented teachers covering the whole district.   this always becomes a hot button issue on reddit, but there are three types of special needs children, you have the standard learning disability student, one that with just a little extra guidance can make it in the real world just the same as any other student in the school. i had a very good friend in high school who was this type of student, and now he's an environmental engineer, and has even given presentations to members of congress. if you were to meet him, you'd have no idea he was a special needs child. the second type, would be what you would picture the typical special education kid, where they are functional physically, but aren't quite all there. they can still get labor jobs after school and lead a happy life afterwards and that's also great!  the third type however is where things fall apart. they consume the most resources, they are typically completely physically disabled and more often completely mentally incapacitated. no matter how much money and care is spent on them they are not going to lead anything close to a normal life, and will often go straight into a care facility upon leaving the school system. this third option shouldn't even be in the school system where the student is incapable of receiving any type of education and the school system is mostly used as a free care facility. they end up hurting those success stories mentioned above in terms of available resources, as well as draining funds that could be used for music, art, extra ap classes, or g&amp;t teachers.",1,,0

""bill nyhan was the guru of metabolism,"" esterly told me.  nyhan, who was then in his thirties, had been studying how cancer cells metabolized amino acids, in an attempt to find ways to cure cancer in children. ""it was one of my impossible projects,"" he said to me recently. nyhan is now a professor of pediatrics at the university of california san diego school of medicine. ""i love working with kids, but dealing with pediatric cancer was depressing, saddening, and, in truth, maddening,"" he said. nyhan ran some tests on matthew's urine, using equipment he had designed. the crystals weren't cystine, or any sort of amino acid. they proved to be uric acid. a high concentration of uric acid in a person's blood can lead to gout, a painful disease in which crystals grow in the joints and extremities, particularly in the big toe. gout has been known since the time of hippocrates, and it occurs mainly in older men. yet the patient here was a little boy. nyhan had a medical student named michael lesch working in his lab, and together they went downstairs.  matthew lay in a bed in an open ward on the second floor of the harriet lane home. he was a spot of energy in the ward, a bright-eyed child with a body that seemed out of control. the staff had tied his arms and legs to the bedframe with strips of white cloth, to keep him from thrashing, and they had wrapped his hands in many layers of gauze; they looked like white clubs. nurses hovered around the boy. ""he knew i was a doctor and he knew where he was. he was alert,"" nyhan says. matthew greeted lesch and nyhan in a friendly way, but his speech was almost unintelligible: he had dysarthria, an inability to control the muscles that make speech. they noticed scarring and fresh cuts around his mouth.  they inspected matthew's feet. no sign of gout. then the boy's arms and legs were freed, and lesch and nyhan saw a complex pattern of stiff and involuntary movements, a condition called dystonia. nyhan had the gauze unwrapped from the boy's hands.  matthew looked frightened. he asked nyhan to stop, and then he began crying. when the last layer was removed, they saw that the tips of several of the boy's fingers were missing. matthew started screaming, and thrust his hands toward his mouth. with a sense of shock, nyhan realized that the boy had bitten off parts of his fingers. he also seemed to have bitten off parts of his lips.  ""the kid really blew my mind,"" nyhan said. ""the minute i saw him, i knew that this was a syndrome, and that somehow all of these things we were seeing were related.""  lesch and nyhan began to make regular visits to the ward. sometimes matthew would reach out and snatch nyhan's eyeglasses and throw them across the room. he had a powerful throw, apparently perfectly controlled, and it seemed malicious. ""sorry! i'm sorry!"" matthew would call, as nyhan went to fetch his glasses.  the doctors persuaded mrs. morlen to bring her older son to the hospital. harold, it turned out, had bitten his fingers even more severely than matthew, and had chewed off his lower lip. both boys were terrified of their hands, and screamed for help even as they bit them. the boys' legs would scissor, and they tended to fling out one arm and the opposite leg, like a fencer lunging. the morlen brothers, the doctors found, had several times more uric acid in their blood than normal children do.  nyhan and lesch visited the morlen home, a row house in a working-class neighborhood in east baltimore, where matthew was living with his mother and grandmother. ""he was a well-accepted member of his little household, and they were very casual about his condition,"" nyhan says. the women had devised a contraption to keep him from biting his hands, a padded broomstick that they placed across his shoulders, and they tied his arms to it like a scarecrow. the family called it the ""stringlyjack."" matthew often asked to wear it.  nyhan and lesch also discovered that they liked the morlen brothers. lesch, who is now the chairman of the department of medicine at st. luke's-roosevelt hospital, in new york city, said, ""matthew and harold were really engaging kids. i enjoyed being around them.""  two years after meeting matthew morlen, nyhan and lesch published the first paper describing the disease, which came to be called lesch-nyhan syndrome. almost immediately, doctors began sending patients to nyhan. very few doctors had ever seen a person with lesch-nyhan syndrome, and boys with the disease were, and are, frequently misdiagnosed as having cerebral palsy. (girls virtually never get it.) nyhan himself found a number of lesch-nyhan boys while visiting state institutions for developmentally disabled people. when i asked him how long it took him to diagnose a case, he said, ""seconds."" he went on, ""you walk into a big room, and you're looking at a sea of blank faces. all of a sudden you notice this kid staring at you. he's highly aware of you. he relates readily to strangers. he's usually off in a corner, where he's the pet of the nurses. and you see the injuries around his lips.""  william nyhan is now eighty-one, a tall, fit man with blondish-gray hair and blue eyes. he has a laboratory overlooking a wild canyon near the u.c.s.d. medical center. one day when i visited him, two red-tailed hawks were soaring above the canyon, tracing circles in the air. in the years since he identified lesch-nyhan, he has discovered or co-discovered a number of other inherited metabolic diseases, and he has developed effective treatments for some of them. he figured out how to essentially cure a rare genetic disorder called multiple carboxylase deficiency, which could kill babies within hours of birth, by administering small doses of biotin, a b vitamin. lesch-nyhan, however, has proved to be more intractable.  decades after the discovery of lesch-nyhan syndrome, it is still mysterious. it is perhaps the clearest example of a simple change in the human dna which leads to a striking, comprehensive change in behavior. in 1971, william nyhan coined the term ""behavioral phenotype"" to describe the nature of diseases like lesch-nyhan syndrome. a phenotype is an outward trait, or a collection of outward traits, that arises from a gene or genes--for example, brown eyes. someone who has a behavioral phenotype displays a pattern of characteristic actions that can be linked to the genetic code. lesch-nyhan syndrome seems to be a window onto the deepest parts of the human mind, offering glimpses of the mechanics of the genetic code operating on thought and personality.",1,,0

354930,"i disagree as a disabled person. there are plenty of fixable handicaps, or adaptational tools, or medical treatments to manage them. bithely saying no-one should be writing about someone trying to overcome a handicap means no-one should be using a wheelchair or prosthetic to make up for a loss of mobility or a loss of a limb, no-one should take antidepressants that allow them respite from mental hell, no-one should seek a cure for their cancer... heck, no one should use sign language etc (the british deaf community is campaigning to have sign language taught in schools and our church group have been learning it too). it applies to certain communities, but it's just silly to pretend it applies to all handicapped people everywhere, including me.  it serves to keep us marginalised so someone else can feel better, not to empower us to deal honestly with our conditions and get help to live the life we ourselves want to live. our situation is not like other identities, where marginalisation is purely social. it's objectively physical, meaning that something inside ourselves keeps us from playing an active part in life. denying us the opportunity to see people tackle a medical condition head on and instead passively 'accept' conditions that range from nuisance to life-threatening is ridiculous. we should have as much choice and agency in that as anyone else has choice and agency in fiction.  i get angry at this kind of attitude. not only it is patronising towards the actual disabled, but it smothers our voices in trying to get the adaptation and medical advances necessary to live life on a par with the non-disabled. and it's sad to see this become such a barrier to genuine discussion amongst writers -- who should be able to broach the difficult subjects surrounding marginalisation. i know people mean well, but the result is just another way of holding us back so that the able-bodied can feel good, not actually asking us what *we* want.  maybe i'm misinterpreting this but i hope that this attitude isn't going to solidify entirely and end up with the medical establishment denying me my anti-anxiety meds because it's part of my 'identity' to be strung out every time the government does something stupid. i started taking them because other therapies didn't work and my husband became seriously ill, meaning that i had to put my disability to one side to look after his, and he still died two years later. it was a struggle for anyone -- neurotypical or otherwise -- but for me with several neurological issues, it was terrifying. i stepped up to the plate and took the meds and they're the best thing ever to happen to me at the absolute darkest time of my life. but i couldn't go on being a nervous wreck and now i've tasted just a little bit of freedom from my original handicaps i'm not going back. i'd rather have that freedom than have to wrestle with them at the same time as wrestling with everything else, and going forward from that disaster, i like the feeling of empowerment that they give me. that empowerment strangely seems an alien thing to allies, but it's released me from the crutches i used to have to lean on, and so why should i not take a pill to overcome a handicap that can be subdued by medication?   so while i understand where this is coming from, please don't generalise or treat disability like another identity. the sj movement has done amazing things, but it's a paradigm which doesn't map very well onto disability beyond a couple of communities. it hurts us more than it helps, particularly because it's silencing voices that should be heard in favour of treating us like saintly 'magical cripples'. enough already.",1,,-1

160032,"transcript (longer version)   i don't like words that hide the truth. i don't words that conceal reality. i don't like euphemisms, or euphemistic language. and american english is loaded with euphemisms. cause americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality. americans have trouble facing the truth, so they invent the kind of a soft language to protest themselves from it, and it gets worse with every generation. for some reason, it just keeps getting worse. i'll give you an example of that. there's a condition in combat. most people know about it. it's when a fighting person's nervous system has been stressed to it's absolute peak and maximum. can't take anymore input. the nervous system has either (click) snapped or is about to snap. in the first world war, that condition was called¬†shell shock. simple, honest, direct language. two syllables,¬†shell shock. almost sounds like the guns themselves. that was seventy years ago. then a whole generation went by and the second world war came along and very same combat condition was called¬†battle fatigue. four syllables now. takes a little longer to say. doesn't seem to hurt as much. fatigue is a nicer word than shock. shell shock! battle fatigue. then we had the war in korea, 1950. madison avenue was riding high by that time, and the very same combat condition was called operational exhaustion. hey, were up to eight syllables now! and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase. it's totally sterile now. operational exhaustion. sounds like something that might happen to your car. then of course, came the war in viet nam, which has only been over for about sixteen or seventeen years, and thanks to the lies and deceits surrounding that war, i guess it's no surprise that the very same condition was called post-traumatic stress disorder. still eight syllables, but we've added a hyphen! and the pain is completely buried under jargon. post-traumatic stress disorder. i'll bet you if we'd of still been calling it shell shock, some of those viet nam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time. i'll betcha. i'll betcha.  but. but, it didn't happen, and one of the reasons. one of the reasons is because we were using that¬†soft¬†language. that language that takes the life out of life. and it is a function of time. it does keep getting worse. i'll give you another example. sometime during my life. sometime during my life, toilet paper became bathroom tissue. i wasn't notified of this. no one asked me if i agreed with it. it just happened. toilet paper became bathroom tissue. sneakers became running shoes. false teeth became dental appliances. medicine became medication. information became directory assistance. the dump became the landfill. car crashes became automobile accidents. partly cloudy bacame partly sunny. motels became motor lodges. house trailers became mobile homes. used cars became previously owned transportation. room service became guest-room dining. and constipation became occasional irregularity. when i was a little kid, if i got sick they wanted me to go to the hospital and see a doctor. now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization...or a wellness center to consult a healthcare delivery professional. poor people used to live in slums. now the economically disadvantaged occupy substandard housing in the inner cities. and they're broke! they're broke! they don't have a negative cash-flow position. they're fucking broke! cause a lot of them were fired. you know, fired. management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area, so many people are no longer viable members of the workforce.  smug, greedy, well-fed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins. it's as simple as that. the cia doesn't kill anybody anymore, they neutralize people...or they depopulate the area. the government doesn't lie, it engages in disinformation. the pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation in something they call sunshine units. israeli murderers are called commandos. arab commandos are called terrorists. contra killers are called freedom fighters. well, if crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire, what do freedom fighters fight? they never mention that part of it to us, do they? never mention that part of it.  and...and some of this stuff is just silly, we all know that, like on the airlines, they say want to pre- board. well, what the hell is pre-board, what does that mean? to get on before you get on? they say they're going to pre-board those passengers in need of special assistance. cripples! simple honest direct language. there is no shame attached to the word cripple that i can find in any dictionary. no shame attached to it, in fact it's a word used in bible translations. jesus healed the cripples. doesn't take seven words to describe that condition. but we don't have any cripples in this country anymore. we have¬†the physically challenged. is that a grotesque enough evasion for you? how about¬†differently abled. i've heard them called that. differently abled! you can't even call these people handicapped anymore. they'll say, ""were not handicapped. were handicapable!"" these poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition, somehow you'll change the condition. well, hey cousin, ppsssspptttttt. doesn't happen. doesn't happen.  we have no more deaf people in this country, hearing impaired. no ones blind anymore, partially sighted or visually impaired. we have no more stupid people. everyone has a learning disorder...or he's minimally exceptional. how would you like to be told that about your child?

(i had it, but i didn't expect to have to pay until the monthly bill came.)  that is what most of us have come to expect from responsible companies.  &gt;if the child is incapable of handling the responsibility, the parent should not give it to them. if they weren't sure and the kid screws up, it's a live'n'learn situation.  the father clearly took pains to try and make sure the daughter could text all she wanted to without incurring extra charges.  do you really think this is reasonable behavior?  do you really think that every contract we sign with every company we deal with should be ""buyer beware because this company will screw you over in a second if you don't read every last letter of the fine print?""  do you conduct business this way?  &gt;now as for the shady companies taking advantage of the poor unfortunate disabled woman... that doesn't fly.  i guess you do your business that way.  i suppose you believe spam is reasonable as well?   &gt;now, as for your credit card company, that's great. nice of them to call you. question: if your electricity bill doubles or triples this month, will your electric company call you part way through the month to warn you? what about heating (assuming you use natural gas or some other city provided heat source)? what about water usage? no? strange, your credit card company does.   actually, yes. there certainly have been instances where water companies have discovered a broken pipe in a customer's home because they noticed the water usage skyrocket - particularly in the case of ""summer homes"" or ""part-of-the-year"" homes.  it is good business practice.  &gt;realize for a moment, your cc company is the exception. most services do not do this.  this will change.  it is a relatively new item, but i will bet you that in a few years there will be legislation that will wipe this crap out and the whole scam ""premium text messaging industry"" will walk off with their money and go find another way to rip people off until they are rousted away from that scam.  http://redtape.msnbc.com/2007/02/premium_text_me.html  &gt;this is why i said, it would have been ~nice~ for them to contact the bill payer. that'd be swell. however, it is not an obligation.  it might not be a legal obligation, but publicly owned companies are expected to follow a certain ethical standard as well.  perhaps he should buy a share of stock and go to the next stockholder's meeting and bring it up...  &gt;if you sued, you'd walk away with the full $10k bill. at least the company was nice enough to drop it to $5k.  yeah, that was real nice of them.  i'm pretty sure my $75 a month will never go to a company that practices that kind of behavior.  it will take a few years, but it will cost them more than $5k to be a part of this kind of shady business.",0,,

([abdul-hamid, walid khalid, and jamie hacker hughes. ""nothing new under the sun: post-traumatic stress disorders in the ancient world."" early science and medicine 19.6 (2014): 549-557.)](http://faithandfire.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/esm_019_06_01-abdul-hamid_hughes-2.pdf) (pdf warning)  in this study, they discussed the fact that basically the entire adult male population was subject to military service every three years. a number of them suffered from symptoms they believed were caused by the ghosts of the enemies they had killed during battle, causing uneasiness and other symptoms.  the authors of the study believe that if one of them were to walk into a clinic today and be diagnosed, it would be called ptsd.  they cite several examples of ancient assyrian medical texts describing symptoms of people afflicted in this way:  &gt;14.34 ‚Äúif his words are unintelligible for three days [‚Ä¶]37 his mouth [f‚Ä¶] and he experiences wandering about for three days in a row f‚Ä¶1.‚Äù  &gt;14.35 ‚Äúhe experiences wandering about (for three) consecutive (days)‚Äù; this means: ‚Äúhe experiences alteration of mentation (for three) consecutive (days).‚Äù  &gt;14.36 ‚Äúif his words are unintelligible and depression keeps falling on him at regular intervals (and he has been sick) for three days f‚Ä¶]‚Äù  also,  &gt;19.32 ‚Äúif in the evening, he sees either a living person or a dead person or someone known to him or someone not known to him or anybody or anything and becomes afraid; he turns around but, like one who has [been hexed with?] rancid oil, his mouth is seized so that he is unable to cry out to one who sleeps next to him, ‚Äòhand‚Äô of ghost (var. hand of [‚Ä¶]).‚Äù  &gt;19.33 ‚Äú[if] his mentation is altered so that he is not in full possession of his faculties, ‚Äòhand‚Äô of a roving ghost; he will die.‚Äù  &gt;19.34 ‚Äúif his mentation is altered, [‚Ä¶] (and) forgetfulness(?) (and) his words hinder each other in his mouth, a roaming ghost afflicts him. (if) [‚Ä¶], he will get well.‚Äù  (i'm not sure which tablets these inscriptions come from, as they are not cited as i would expect, given that the article is a medical journal rather than an archaeological one)  another example they cite is the description of the king of elam (a near eastern polity located in western iran) and how his ""mind changed"" after a war.  the really tricky part is whether these ancient stresses and reactions to the violence and brutality of war result in the same disorder as ptsd, or whether there are subtleties that make modern ptsd and the modern stresses that cause it a different ailment.  we can't directly diagnose an assyrian soldier haunted by the ghosts of the enemies he killed, so we can't answer that question, all we can do is interpret what they tell us about their lives in a framework that we can understand.  the article i cited above describes several other ancient accounts of afflictions resulting from battle stress, including a soldier who fought in the battle of marathon, who suffered from blindness that appears to be psychosomatic in nature, resulting from psychological trauma suffered during the battle:  &gt;epizelus, the son of cuphagorus, an athenian soldier, was fighting bravely when he suddenly lost sight of both eyes, though nothing had touched him anywhere ‚Äì neither sword, spear, nor missile. from that moment he continued blinded as long as he lived. i am told that in speaking about what happened to him he used to say that he fancied he was opposed by a man of great stature in heavy armour, whose beard overshadowed his shield but the phantom passed him by and killed the man at his side. (p. 3)  therefore, scholars believe we have depictions of mental illness similar to ptsd occurring during the time of the assyrians, ~1300-600 bc.  another type of discussion of ancient mental illness is the description of alexander the great's brother arrhidaeus, whose mental capacity was commented on by ancient historians. i'm not entirely sure if we could diagnose arrhidaeus with anything conclusive, given the lack of evidence and the long time gap, and the large difference in medical knowledge.  what i can tell you is that plutarch, in his [life of alexander, book 77 section 5](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=perseus:text:1999.01.0243:chapter=77&amp;highlight=arrhidaeus) states that   &gt;arrhidaeus was philip's son by an obscure and common woman named philinna, and was deficient in intellect owing to bodily disease. this, however, did not come upon him in the course of nature or of its own accord, indeed, it is said that as a boy he displayed an exceedingly gifted and noble disposition: but afterwards olympias gave him drugs which injured his body and ruined his mind.  so it seems that he somehow had brain damage inflicted upon him somewhat later in life, at least as understood by plutarch, who lived approximately 300 years after alexander.  in addition, the [heidelberg epitome 1-2](http://www.attalus.org/translate/fgh.html#155.0) recounts that  &gt;because arrhidaeus was dull-witted, and also epileptic, perdiccas was appointed to be guardian and overseer of the royal government.  a good summary of the evidence for arrhidaeus' affliction can be located in andrew chubb's [the death of alexander the great: a reconstruction of cleitarchus](https://books.google.com/books?id=pvhqagaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa32&amp;lpg=pa32&amp;dq=plutarch+on+arrhidaeus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-xzonhs2eb&amp;sig=a5fy6bwzkfxs6zujheoqocalk4i&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cdkq6aewbwovchmiw8gzga_uyaivcpi-ch2boauv#v=onepage&amp;q=plutarch%20on%20arrhidaeus&amp;f=false).  if you want to read the texts for yourself, you can google the references and you should be able to pretty easily find full translated texts of all the documents.  i'm not sure if ""learning disability"" is the right term for the condition, or if ""mentally disabled"" or ""brain-damaged"" would be better, given that it seems less like he had trouble learning and more like he was considered to be impaired (referred to as an ""imbecile"" in [plutarch's phocion](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=perseus:text:2008.01.0057:chapter=32&amp;highlight=arrhidaeus), for example.  if plutarch is correct in understanding that the affliction came post-childhood, then it could be either the result of a failed poisoning causing brain damage (perhaps by oxygen deprivation) as plutarch accuses, or it could be the result of a natural disease, such as epilepsy (as alleged in the hedelberg epitome), which may induce the same state through natural means.  it's possible that arrhidaeus had a seizure which caused brain damage.  since these are the texts that give us the details, we can't know for sure.  my instinct is to guess something along the lines of brain damage, based on what plutarch tells us about how he was normal and bright in childhood, but i wouldn't venture to guess on whether it was caused by natural disease or failed poisoning.  both have an equal chance, in my opinion.  the common thread in these cases is the description of symptoms that we have.  if the effects of whatever the ailment was fit a psychological disorder or mental illness definition, then it can be advanced as a potential diagnosis.  we have the descriptions of assyrian warriors haunted by the ghosts of their victims, and greeks with survivors' guilt and psychosomatic blindness.  these seem to fit modern definitions, and all we can do is take what they tell us about themselves and say, if this person walked into a clinic and this is all they said to the doctor, what would the diagnosis be?  in the end, we have to engage it in the same way they did, and see how their original diagnosis fit in their society.  we can speculate what the modern diagnosis might be, and thus write with definitions that have meaning to us, but in the end, we have to work with the descriptions that are left to us.",1,,0

719802,"there's a fellow who operates a channel [br3adsquad](https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucylixs4tzvbjayhk8wmatcw) who is openly neurodivergent  that i really like. i believe it's a collaboration between several radical leftists though. you are right though in that we are severely lacking in representation. so onto the talking points.  &amp;#x200b;  &gt;  what are the current barriers for disabled and neurodivergent content creators?   &amp;#x200b;  that's a really difficult and worthwhile question. i can only offer my lived experience and my own inferences. media is an extremely competitive and saturated industry. not only do you've to manage to communicating exciting and novel ideas or analysis in an engaging way, it has to be immediately relatable and accessible to a significant demographic. i've seen it where extremely thorough and worthwhile analysis gets trapped at a couple dozen views. even if people would like it, or gain from it, they've to be captured by it and watch it first.   &amp;#x200b;  the 'norm' in media is extremely narrow: white, male, attractive, hetero, cis, neurotypical, ablebodied, presentable and articulate (middleclass or up). this also includes regional exclusions for accents such as the rural south or anything outside of the core anglosphere. if this is presented, it is uncritically accepted as 'just a person'. if any of these conditions are deviated from, it is a notable trait that is factored into and against your viewership-- it is something 'other' that must be capitalized upon with a niche appeal or persuaded away with excellence. if you meet this criteria, you are a youtube content creator. if you don't, you are a *black* youtube content creator or a *trans* youtube content creator, etc,..  &amp;#x200b;  one of the ways to exist against such bias is to embrace that unique identifier. it's unfortunate but real. this option coincides with the 'responsibility' to 'represent' this demographic that can be demanded of creators-- contrapoints being the most well known example. disabled and neurodivergent people don't have this option. i have cmt-x-linked, a form of neuromuscular dystrophy. while i share traits with disabled and neurodivergent people like being discriminated against and limited by this condition, i've no idea what it's like to have blindness or autism. that is, we are an intrinsically fragmented minority. this is the primary reason why advocacy for disability tends to cluster around particular states of being rather than broad or cohesive movements.  &amp;#x200b;  so we lack a significant native audience of people like ourselves while also lacking the ability to not be detected as uncomfortably different from either the media norm and the larger actual population. our otherness is particularly intense.   &amp;#x200b;  this is all before we factor in the real limitations on our ability. so far i've only touched on the politics of perception. i have pain,difficulty with anything requiring dexterity. insomnia (the pain is too intense for me to sleep). my brother, who is 30 with the same disease, suffers from strokes and hypertension from an abnormal mutation-- it is hardly difficult to imagine how that might interfere with working. someone who is neurodivergent might find it difficult to communicate or understand ironic humour or parse certain arguments, particularly when they're made in bad faith. someone with attention deficits might find it difficult to focus on the finer details that polish videos. someone with blindness might have to worry about making their audience uncomfortable with a wandering eye that they can't even see or control. someone who is deaf has to worry about how their voice might come across to a person with hearing. and of course all of us will have to find a way to emotionally cope with the bullying native to social media, where complete strangers will look for every soft spot possibly related to our disability and harass us into feeling small for it.  &amp;#x200b;  &gt; how can we support disabled and neurodivergent content creators?   &amp;#x200b;  i think this post is actually an amazing way. i think because of the weakness in our ability to persistently advocate or find solidarity, we largely become invisible as a group. this isn't because we lack comrades who care but just the nature of how talking points and issues become boosted or muted. so bringing ourselves to the conversation on our own initiative, reminding our allies that we're hear and we need to be heard, is excellent.  &amp;#x200b;  the larger point is the larger problem i've alluded to, which is dissolving the false separateness between the various disability and atypical expressions of our bodies and minds. it's unlikely that you suffer from palsy but we both likely know what it is like to feel lesser, to be considered less, for how we are born. this is an issue far more massive than any single media or even representation but i think it starts with us talking about it openly like this.  &amp;#x200b;  i would really appreciate though if the more prominent contributors and artists could try to make a concerted effort to seek out disabled and neurodivergent content creators and signal boost the shit out of 'em. even just one prominent voice could break the silence.  &amp;#x200b;  &gt; what would you like to see most from disabled and neurodivergent content creators?   &amp;#x200b;  again, this is extremely personal and only reflect myself. but i would love to see one of us being open about their suffering without contorting it into some triumph against adversity or 'inspiration'. to the able-bodied reading this-- first off, thank you-- there are dynamics of shame, resentment, and expectation placed on those who aren't able-bodied or neurotypical. if i'm being entirely honest, it can be far worse than the condition itself. there are tasks that might seem simple or essential that are extremely and painfully difficult or outright impossible for us. i understand that you might like the video of a fellow without arms painting a masterpeice with their teeth and then laughing with a hearty warmth after. *that is not a realistic or reasonable expectation and it's not defeatism to admit that*.  &amp;#x200b;  disability and neurodivergence can be painful and isolating. this can result in perfectly normal and acceptable periods of exhaustion, envy, and hurt. except because of all the fetishization of our indomitable spirits, this can lead to loved ones resenting us for complaining or 'feeling sorry for ourselves' or, worst of all, 'using our disability as an excuse or crutch'. we sometimes just need room to acknowledge that it can suck and have that heard. and we need role models who are brave enough to not put on a brave face. i, desperately, need someone i can see and respect who feels what i do and works with it rather than some 'wholesome' montage of 'overcoming adversity'. i am tired of being made to feel small for feeling tired.   &amp;#x200b;  i recognise this became awfully personal and revealing but i think if i'm feeling it this strongly, i am not unique or alone in this so i figured it was important to be honest.  &amp;#x200b;  &gt; as a final note, i have considered making content myself, as a queer, disabled and neurodivergent leftist, but understand the risks and difficulties of that. would anyone have any words of motivation and hope for people like myself who want to make their voices heard, but are significantly disadvantaged in online spaces?   &amp;#x200b;  i am a queer and disabled leftist who has considered making content. i understand the risk and difficulties of that. the only motivation i can offer is that you aren't alone in this. if ever you need help, feel free to shoot me a message and i'll offer whatever i can.",1,,2

731702,"i've posted about this before. i'm thinking of turning it into a massive f7u12 comic.  **tl;dr**: i once saw a version of a midsummer night's dream on an english school trip that featured a midget and a guy in an electric wheelchair with cerebral palsy. i am usually capable of the finest pokerface but with friends, it turned into a 3 hour marathon of trying to suppress the giggles.  posted for your reading pleasure:  the play began. all the characters arrived on stage, the men in military uniforms, the women wearing veils. the bottom row of seating was actually on the stage, with the seating flanking the stage front, left and right. me and my classmates we sat on the second row back, just above actor eye-level.  now, the audience is all in a hush, completely quiet as the cast begin to speak. then something starts to feel wrong. my friend next to me is vibrating with suppressed giggles. more classmates sitting on the opposite side of the stage were also suppressing giggles, hands over their faces. and then i notice, one of the characters was a dwarf, about 3ft tall, wearing a veil. now normally, this wouldn't phase me. however, the effect of the near silent, packed, theatre and the knowledge that laughing would be an awful, awful thing, caused me to start to giggle, you know, the near uncontrollable desire to laugh out loud. the play was continuing. every now and then you could hear a funny noise from someone in the audience who had accidentally breathed and let out a little laugh. of course, the effect of one person giggling is toxic, you start to laugh at them laughing, starting a chain reaction.  the play lasted three hours. three hours of trying not to laugh, of rib-searing pain. at one point the dwarf got some bells and started to dance around the stage. the seating was literally shaking for that one.  for a portion of the play (at least a third), there were these multi-coloured balls covering the stage, of all sizes. some of the bigger balls were larger than the dwarf. and she was pushing them around. when this happened the college student behind us just lost it, letting out ripping laughter, luckily ignored. another moment, the cast we running and chasing each other on stage, with lights flashing, loud music. seeing the dwarf pattering, jumping around just made most of the audience just completely lose it.  the words of my english teacher upon seeing the dwarf: ""oh shit"".  the wheelchair guy zipped around the stage so fast that he catapulted the balls covering the stage into the audience. the dwarf was nearly trapped under his wheels at one point.  puck, one of the characters, for a small part of the play sat on the seat next to my friend just on the end of the row. suffice to say, he was feeling awkward. at one point the dwarf and wheelchair guy had not been on stage for a few minutes, allowing us to calm down slightly. as the lead characters engaged in a romantic scene, the music dimmed, the theatre was near silent. then, the same friend sitting on the end of the row, made the tiniest farting sound with his mouth, probably an escaped giggle. this set us all off shaking again, not daring to breathe to prevent any noise.  the sex scene went off with all manner of flashing lights and running about. seeing the wheelchair guy chasing the dwarf down was so hilarious, we were just openly laughing our heads off. my friend next to me was red-faced, half out of his seat, leaning over me and just roaring with laughter.  at the back of the stage, there was a grassy hemisphere. at some point all the characters were learning against this. except the wheelchair guy, all the characters wondering 'where's wheelchair guy?'. so the characters are talking, and the next thing we know, wheelchair guy, rises over the back of the hemisphere, on his hands and knees, grovelling along the floor and cries 'helllloooooooooo!'. we nearly wet ourselves. the audience was mainly composed of school-kids my age and old people. not even a giggle escaped the old folks until the slapstick part of the play. poker-faces all round. another squad of classmates were sitting in the main seating, next to a load of croaks. the contrast was amazing. one side was amazingly blank-faced and still. the other had hands over their faces, shoulders going up and down.  i remember, when first taking my seat, that the front row, just below me had a blind guy sitting with a guide-dog and his handler. one of the theatre staff came too him just before the start of the play and asked him to move to the back - presumably because his dog would get in the way. afterwards, i wondered what the hell he would have thought of the play from the sound of it and the laughs coming from behind him.  the interval was basically a chance for people to recover their breath and ask wtf was going on? is this deliberate? are we supposed to laugh? so the play resumes, and two characters are on stage. i start to giggle uncontrollably again. there was nothing to laugh at, but the mere anticipation of what was to come was enough to set me off. i must have been the only one giggling and i was making small 'meep' noises whenever i breathed in. slowly, one by one the others succumbed to the giggles, and the play continued.  the guy in an electric wheelchair would whiz around the stage quite fast. he quite clearly had some sort of neural disorder (i later learned that it was cerebral palsy), but the cast had him out of chair, grovelling on the floor, pulling himself around with his arms. horrifically indecent, but i'll admit was a factor adding to the giggle-pressure. then the cast decided to, dress the guy in the wheelchair as a *wall*. on stage. in front of everyone. we sat for five minutes watching him trying to get a jumper on, as the cast lowered a fabric-covered bamboo frame over his chair. he then preceded to charge members of the audience, ramming them with the frame. in one scene, he deliberately reversed over the lead actor's foot and over his cape as he tried to walk about. then we realised. it was slapstick comedy, with the disabled. the disabled guy we later found out was a comedian. in fact he was starring in a play titled 'spastic fantastic'. the last thirty minutes would be hilarious for anyone who just walked into the theatre. we had spent so long giggling to ourselves, we were completely desensitised to anything. the play ended with a dance. the dwarf pulled people on the front rows up to come and dance. my friend looked eye-to-eye with the lead actor and said he saw only misery and self-hate.",1,,-2

616510,"i can give my own perspective on this.  hi, i am a little one-eyed retard with hearing aids and for a majority of my life, i have been taught the fine art of self-shame by the examples set by all the beautiful normal perfectly healthy social adepts in the wild.  people like me aren't *supposed* to feel confident and capable of achieving our dreams; remember, we're drains on taxpayer dollars and divert attention from those who truly deserve a chance at employment or true love.  so when i go to a job interview in a newly-pressed suit and a fresh shave, fully prepared to knock down barriers and overcome obstacles, i don't carry any negative pessimism with me.  i don't even think of myself as disabled or handicapped; instead, i play into this ideal mental picture of a tall manly man with beautiful eyes and the whole ""fake it 'til you make it"" act helps me keep calm and articulate myself in a palatable manner.  the shame sets in later when i find myself in the location after not having heard any response from them and seeing a new hire in my desired position performing their job less than optimally.  the shame hurts because here are these individuals, chosen for their supposed healthy advantage with both eyes that has 20/20 vision plus clear hearing and the photogenic advantage of appearing ""perfectly healthy and normal"", and they just don't *give a shit* about their jobs -- and their bosses know it.  the reasoning behind this being, ""i'd rather have the over-qualified xxx420snipleriferxxx manning the counter so he can barely make a dent in paying off his high-interest loan for his awesome vanity car than give iwanttobenormal the chance to build job experience while earning the income he really needs to afford basic necessities.""  i'm ashamed every time i get rejected, whether it's by no response or it's to tell me that the position has already been/will be filled by someone better qualified (even for a nursing home dishwasher?), it's another hint informing me that i'm not worthy of becoming part of a productive society.  my life is worthless because no one wants me to work, and if i can't work i can't support myself, and if i can't support myself i'll starve and go homeless.  no one wants me to work because i am an ugly little fucking one-eyed retard with hearing aids, and while this unspoken rule of a well-oiled, functioning society will never be acknowledged because it's ""rude"" and ""tactless"", people will continue to preserve their illusion of a perfect world by quietly manipulating circumstances to keep people like me out of the public eye and under the poverty level.  this shit is hard, but can you imagine how much harder it would be for me if i allowed myself to stop for just one second and picture myself as i truly am?  my imagination would absolutely paralyze me with the shit that people say about me after i've left the interview.  three months ago, i had an interview at staples which involved the initial person becoming more jovial and amused by what i'm sure were standard responses to his questions and bringing in three managers, individually one after the other, from off the floor to smirk with twinkling eyes at me as the interview progressed.  i have not done or said anything any differently than how other people would have acted; it's just amusing to them to see a retard who thinks he's people.  obviously i never got a response for the job, but if i allow myself to give up because i let my imagination run wild with the scenario of them cackling and making fun of me after i've left and *boo-hoo, this is how everyone will think of me*, i will have no one but myself to blame when i starve, go homeless, and lack the funds to buy hearing aid batteries so i can function in society.  becoming sedentary in defeat is not an option for someone like me when it comes to my survival and my future.  i don't like how i look.  i don't like how other people's responses to me closes so many windows of opportunity that makes a comfortable living possible.  i don't like how people assume that because i look weak, they could manipulate, use, and take advantage of me.  and when i become stubborn and resistant, they resort to physical intimidation...which often works because i am small.  i don't like that i'm going to go blind, which will leave me wide open to even more skimming of my personal resources.  i should be ashamed of myself.  fuck it, i *am* ashamed of myself, for being born and living and trying to wedge my way as a cog into the great economic machinery when there's a big bright red hint flashing on everyone's foreheads reading, ""go home you worthless insufferable deformity"".  but this is just an intangible emotion that makes my heart ache and my stomach upset and my face feel hot, but there's no gun to my head forcing me to stay indoors.  no safety net for me means that it's up to me, myself, and i alone to make the executive decision to keep bathing, submitting those resumes, and pounding the pavement to get my ^^ugly ^^fucking ^^retard face out there in the thin, vain hopes that someday, somewhere, someone will take pity upon me and give me the opportunity to prove myself as a capable, productive member of society.  when the day comes that i find myself unable to pay rent, or my remaining good eye's retina snaps and leaves me in a world of forever eigengrau and uselessness, the only thing that i wouldn't be able to say is, ""welp, that's because i didn't try my best!""  i'm stuck in this ""uniform"" that is my body which i have to present to the world each and every day.  i can't conceal it.  my body and face are what they are.  i can conceal my uncertainty and the fact that i'm in over my head when it comes to social situations, because a nice fat paycheck to ensure my continued future comfort is a nice carrot on a stick to help me leap those awkward hurdles that arises when someone dares to engage me in conversation.  i can tune up my mannerisms in a mirror and talk to myself to practice my diction when i'm alone.  i can engage with random people on tinychat and hear the same old song and dance about ""you don't look that bad, i'd hire you if i were a boss, it's stupid to discriminate and be prejudiced, everyone deserves to live and be happy"", which cheers me up to a degree but is soured when i realized that it's much easier to reassure over a long distance (""i'll pray for you!"") than it is to actually take action to help someone like me take that first step towards self-sufficiency.  the most shameful thing of all that i have to carry with me?  this unspoken social etiquette will always exist.  when faced, people will say ""oh no, i have no problems with that person at all, they just didn't have the necessary combination of experience and skill set to unload dirty dishes from meal racks and load them into a dishwasher in a nursing home kitchen,"" but in the back of their adult 40something-year-old minds, they're cackling like fifteen-year-olds with their buddies about the absurdity of a fucking retard like me shouldering such a tremendous responsibility -- which they'll never truly get the chance to experience because i was never given the opportunity to prove them wrong.  nor could i file papers by alphabetical and chronological order in filing cabinets under a time limit -- which i could very well do given half the chance.  oh, and forget even rolling dough to make breadsticks at a pizza chain!  someone might catch my deaf-and-blind disease from my hearing aid and dead eye, even if i wash my hands!  :(  but, eh, here's the good news, i guess -- those thoughts are just as intangible as farts and your own sense of self-shame.  whenever the potential for a sudden overwhelming panic should occur in any scenario, i just have to remind myself:  they're not going to tattoo their thoughts onto my forehead.  i'm not going to leave the interview with ""tell me to kill myself"" signs on my back.  they're just going to make the present moment suck for me as much as possible, and however i conduct myself will only leave a lasting impression on *me* only if i let it.  the managers at staples aren't going to call up the managers at best buy and give them a heads-up about the funny-looking hard-of-hearing fellow that they had fun tripping up with mumbled, overlapping questions asked by the three of them at once.  my failures don't follow me everywhere i go; each interview is a fresh start where i apply what i've learned from my previous mistakes.  my resume kicks ass; their disappointment with me when they meet me in person does not, and no matter how concise and well-spoken my responses are, my presentation is already spoiled by the defective appearance of the package that delivers it.  i just can't allow self-shame to shackle me to the bench and keep me from trying again, because the only other option is to just completely give up altogether and admit that i'm absolutely utterly worthless.  :)",1,,-2

715112,"so i do 25 - 30 shows a year for my local children's hospital in wi, usa. the hospital i work at is a regional hospital that provides specialized treatment for very sick children (organ transplants, cancer) throughout the midwest in addition to being the trauma and burn unit for our state. although the work was initially organized by the make a wish foundation, they aren't really involved anymore. i perform two small stage shows (there are two floors of sick kids) and then i go room to room for the kids unable to leave their rooms. i perform for the sick kids, their families, and their visitors. you should not under estimate how much you can help a mother with a very sick child who has been sleeping (or just lying awake worrying) on a hospital couch for three nights, with a little entertaining distraction. these are some of the things i have learned in the 7 years i have been doing these shows:  you will be performing for a lot of kids with special needs. it is not always obvious who has special needs or what those needs are. i like to really involve my audiences, for something like ""crazy man's handcuffs"" you need a spectator with use of both hands.  i regularly have groups of 5 or 6 kids, all of them have the use of only one hand(injury, iv, disability). some developmentally disabled kids don't look disabled at all, some kids who look really disabled aren't mentally impaired at all. try to get the volunteer coordinator to give you a heads up when  something isn't obvious.  you will be expected to wash your hands a lot, and use a lot of that hand sanitizer. you will not be allowed to use latex balloons (needle through balloon, phone in balloon), fire, or live animals.  the fire is a big thing, obviously you don't want to burn someone who is already sick, but the problem is some kids have oxygen pumped into their rooms. it permeates all of their sheets and clothes. they get a mask to come to your show, but everything else is still 'soaked' in oxygen. if they come into contact with a flame, a spark, or anything hot they actually explode. you should think long and hard before you bring anything that uses batteries, or has metal moving parts (no electric touch, funkenring, spider pen, tarantula, etc.)  i think coins are the perfect prop for hospitals. i rub them with hand sanitizer when ever i do my hands. even really disabled or very drugged kids like and watch the shiny coin disappear and appear somewhere else. you won't go wrong learning a couple of standing coin routines.  some kids are in isolation. sometimes it is because they can get you sick, sometimes it is because they are immuno-suppressed and you can make them very sick. you can don the mask, hat, gloves, and gown; but see if it is possible to have them sit near the door while you perform in the hallway. my hospital has pressure regulated rooms that make this possible, your results may vary. for these performances, my go-to trick is the invisible deck. these kids aren't allowed to have contact with the outside world so there is a thrill when they get to break the rules and catch an invisible deck i throw them. they flip over an imagined card, throw the deck back, and a real deck lands in a paper bag. when we open the box, the card they imagined turning over is the only card in the deck that is face down, which is a very magical moment. unfortunately kids don't really play cards anymore so you have to quiz them ahead of time to find out if they know what the suits and possible values are. fall back to your coin flurry in cases where you don't think cards are appropriate.  rubber bands are also great because you can replace them every show or give them away as souvenirs.  one downside to performing for sick kids is sometimes you are performing for really sick kids. if everyone watching your show is in a lot of pain you might not get the reactions you deserve. i have made several very embarrassing mistakes. i joked with a kid who had been in a car accident that i looked much worse when my older sister beat me up, only to find out he had lost his entire family including his sister in that accident. i pushed the joke because i thought it deserved a laugh; it wasn't very funny in hindsight. it is better to play it safe, you can have a great show and a likable personality without being overly familiar. you might find that a little distance adds to your persona's mystique. i once embarrassed myself because i didn't have anything to perform for a blind guy. i still don't have anything to perform for the blind.   there are rules that people who work with sick kids follow. i don't know all the reasons why these rules exist, but i work with experts and i trust them. never talk about your self. no personal information, no stories about the time you broke your arm; you are there to listen. never, ever, make a promise to anyone; it isn't necessary, just tell them you will see if you can (even if you know you can) and then deliver.  pm me if you have any specific questions or if you come up with any routines you really like.  edit: oh look, i wrote an essay;

784318,"my wtf nanny experience from hell:  so we'll call her ""a""   let's start with the fact that i was nanny #9 in one year.  ""a"" was fucking insane  -the kids are 11 and 6 the 11 year old had spastic paraplegic cerebral palsy, and was fully disabled and wheelchair bound, no ability to speak or any emotional range beyond comfort vs. discomfort.  and the 6 year old, due to being constantly ignored by his mother and his psycho mothers behavior resulting in him being strung through a series of nannies; the kid was turning into a psychopath. literally.  i would find drawings illustrating his plans to kill his sister and nannies, saying how the weaknesses of the nannies are car crashes and getting fired.  and with the nanny before me, he clawed his arm to pieces and told her he would tell his mom that she did it to him; this was for being told to eat his dinner.  with me, he waited in his room with the light off, after i told him to get dressed, thinking he went out to breakfast, i went to collect his nightclothes for the laundry, as i saw him, i apologized and shut his door. he came out and told me he's going to tell his mom that i tried to look at him naked.   i told her about it and she simply told me he's being a kid.  that's not fucking normal on either front.   i really grew to love him though, despite violent outbursts and the creepy behavior, because it was so obviously the result of his desperate need to feel loved and noticed.   now, the 11 year old, being completely disabled, you would think had all the attention, but that's only true from the nurses and nannies. but their mom avoided all possibly contact with her kids. i was there from 6 am to 7 pm every day, with a couple hours off while they were at school. she wouldn't get them up in the morning or have breakfast with them, nothing, even on days she had extra time she'd go for a run instead.   (i explained the following on a thread about the most selfish thing as well)   but this is in virginia, ""a"" worked in dc, she's a lieutenant colonel (af), and her net income is between $15,000-$20,000 per month, this is with her base pay, basic allowance for housing, ssi for the disabled child, alimony and child support.  she lives in a $750,000 house and brags frequently about her ability to pad her retirement account.  so, the 11 year old had severe scoliosis and had to have a full spinal fusion surgery shortly after i started work there.  this is where the vertebrae are drilled out and pins and rods are connected to correct the shape of the spine.  afterwards, this kid is in immense pain, but her mother does not care.  she's more concerned with the expenses of her care.  keep in mind, the military pays for all of the medical care, medicaid pays for in home nursing and my pay way 75% covered by medicaid as well.  so ""a"", is barely paying anything out of pocket, and what she does pay, is also partially covered by child support.   regardless, only 2 weeks after the surgery, ""a"" took her off the morphine, so she would no longer need a nanny and nurse all day and could send her daughter back to the special needs program in her public school, which is free, even though the child is in horrific pain and has a healing scar all the way from neck to the base of her spine.   this poor thing would scream and howl in absolute agony when the nurses and i had to move and change and bathe her.  it was horrific, and i cried daily having to put her through it.   additionally, she refuses to get a van with a wheelchair lift, because insurance would only cover 80% of the cost, so this child has to be lifted up into a car seat every day, even after the spinal surgery.   she complains constantly about care costs, and then brags openly about her savings and expensive home and furniture and clothes.   and she refuses to put the child in a nursing home, because then the disability money would go there instead of into her bank account.   so these two kids, have a mom that doesn't love them at all and does everything she can to keep from having to interact with them or show them any affection.   and she has majority custody, their dad only gets them every other weekend, despite spending tens of thousands on lawyers and court fees to try to get them more.    it's an absolute mess. and my heart still breaks for the kids. i had to leave after a couple months because she tries to blame the nannies for causing the seizures that she would have daily anyway. she's probably going to die in the care of a nanny or nurse, because her life expectancy is only 16-20. and i wouldn't be the one her mom will try to blame.   this crazy bitch would also try to tell me i wasn't allowed to do things on my time off like going on a weekend trip ""in case i would be tired on monday"" - i was not a live in. but she was trying to enforce a curfew for me and question me about what i did on my time off.   i mentioned that my husbands army buddies would stay with us frequently and she commented on how i always ""have a string of men in my house"" wtf bitch.   the whole situation was horrible and i can't imagine how the 6 year old is going to turn out after being raised in that situation.    sorry for the really long post. but that's my experience. and i always wonder what other nannies go through after having heard several messed up ones from other nannies  that i know personally",1,,-2

880717,"&gt; so how is the parent not the slave to the child then?   the parent can easily remove them-self from the relationship by offering it to services available for just such cases.  &gt; as the child grows they're going to demand more and more food and the parent is forced to labor to feed that child.   the amount of effort is inconsequential to the principle .  &gt; what labor does the parent get in return for all this service to the child?   beyond the intangible benefits of having a child, there is certainly gain to be had. if you raise a happy, healthy child, in many cases their will eventually be some monetary gain. but, again, that's an aside not crucial to the principle.  &gt; is there at least a debt to care for the parent in their old age?  from an ethical/moral standpoint, perhaps. from a legal standpoint, no. again, the child did not choose to be born nor to be placed in position of total dependency, the parent chose that.  &gt; rothbard referred to children in a similar fashion, calling them ""house guests"". i don't think you even need to go so far as to make them disabled. if you invite someone to stay at your house, promising food and shelter, does that really change your legal responsibility if you want to kick them out?  it **does** matter that they are disabled. it's one thing to kick a typical house guest out because, first, if they are simply a guest then their is no expectation of permanent/perpetual residence. secondly, a typical house guest could fend for themselves were they to be kicked out.  the difference with a disabled (not just any disability, i mean completely debilitating such as some quadriplegics) is that even though you are kicking them out, **they can't even physically leave**. to allow a quadriplegic or a child to simply die on your couch or doorstep without making any effort to provide other arrangements is, in my opinion, premeditated murder as you can reasonably suppose that they will die and because they can reasonably claim dependency upon you (to varying extents).  &gt; a child or a disabled person are fully responsible for themselves, therefore they should be able to care for themselves and not rely solely on the charity of others.   let's be clear what i mean by ""child"" and ""disabled person"": someone who has no reasonable ability to care for themselves in almost any way. a child of nine or ten could very likely survive on their own. a blind or deaf person likewise. a six-month old baby, on the other hand, has no shot as would be the case for many paralyzed individuals.  &gt; i can understand you believe there is a moral obligation, but it's not fair to impose your moral beliefs onto others. a society is form on minimum legal obligations.  i'm speaking of cases that i would consider both a moral and legal obligation. though i realize an-caps in general despise anything with even the color of ""social contract"" (as do i) that does not negate the principle of implied contract by reasonable expectation.  if you place someone in life-or-death situation by decisions you make, there is an implied contract of responsibility.  you may initially disagree with that, but it is, in fact, the basis of many a claim. there is an implied contract, whether physically signed or not, that when you sell a product to a person it will not be harmful to them unless it is reasonably expected to be so (common knowledge or specific labeling, etc). likewise for cases of fraud.   &gt; remember that in an anarchy, there is no commons/public space. you can't just wheel a handicap person onto your neighbors property and tell them the disabled person is their problem.   agreed. there are much better options available than attempting to dump them on your neighbors property.  &gt; the best you can really do is tell the other human that your charity is over and you expect them to leave.   in a situation where you have not intentionally structured your relationship with them in such a way as to make yourself of life-and-death importance to their most basic needs, that would be fine.",1,,0

180759,"&gt; as far as your analogy, you're talking about giving medical support to some random dude. that's not analogous to pregnancy, where (over) nine times out of ten, the mother is responsible for the fetus's predicament  well, you even said you think rape victims should be forced to watch in horror as their body changes before their eyes as a result of their traumatic experience, as their dna combines with their rapist's dna and feeds off their body, potentially causing life-long physical changes or complications (note: while complications are relatively uncommon, the *majority* of pregnancies cause physical changes, ranging from differences in body shape to decreased sexual pleasure, incontinence, and a higher risk of diabetes), and that they should go through hours of extreme, potentially life-threatening pain to bring their rapist's child into the world to serve as a permanent physical reminder of the (most likely) worst thing that ever happened to them.  but sure, totally not analogous to you being obligated to be hooked up to someone to save their life.  regardless, would you support it if you were responsible for the guy's situation, then? if you accidentally caused someone to nearly die, and they could only be saved by being hooked up to you for almost a year, should you be forcibly hooked up to them with no option to refuse? if you want to argue that *morally* you should, that's one thing, but you can't be forced to do so.  &gt; would you support...  your arguments have one enormous difference between those situations and abortion--you're talking about killing living, breathing human beings with fully formed brains capable of some degree of thought. abortion typically involves killing a fetus whose brain hasn't developed yet, and is therefore wholly incapable of even the thoughts a lizard might have. the life of a clump of cells with no real brain *is not* more important than the life of an adult woman with a family, friends, spouse, children, job, dreams, hopes, fears, interests, etc. a cow suffers more being raised to make hamburgers than a fetus does due to an abortion, because the cow is legitimately more sentient than a fetus in the first couple months of pregnancy.  a fetus is human, in that it is made of human dna, but so is cancer. it is alive, in that it is capable of growth, but so is a plant. what defines us as human beings is our ability to think and feel. even extremely mentally handicapped people (since i can see that being raised as an objection) clearly do have thoughts and feelings. a fetus whose brain physically does not exist yet does not and cannot. therefore, even if they are human and living, they are not truly living human beings at that point.  but to single out one ""what if""...  &gt; would you support killing a child with rapid-aging syndrome? even if that child would only live to age 9?  would you support euthanizing a sick, elderly dog that you know won't make it more than a few miserable weeks, at best? would you support allowing a young child who has spent their entire life fighting cancer that you now know is unavoidably terminal to die peacefully rather than drag on, suffering, for months?  i cannot tell any parent what to do or how to cope with such a devastating situation as finding out their child has tay-sachs (my example from before), but personally, i would consider it cruel to *not* have an abortion in that situation. they shouldn't be brought into the world to have just a few months of normalcy before deteriorating to the point where they are blind, deaf, paralyzed, and unable to swallow, dying before they're even old enough to understand that they're alive. how could anyone stand by a watch a child suffer like that, when they could do something to prevent it? we aren't talking about a child with even a slim chance of surviving this. they *will* die within a few years. again, if a parent decides for themselves that they want the child to be born so they can have that time, that's their choice, but i could never do that to my child.  &gt; let me present to you a different metaphor. let's say a woman and her newborn infant are stranded somewhere, and for whatever reason, her breast milk is the only baby food available...  i guess that depends. what effect does feeding the baby have on the mother? if she can survive with feeding the baby for 5 days or without feeding the baby for two weeks, it may sadly be impossible for the baby to survive long enough to be rescued. this isn't a simple ""do or don't"" thing--breastfeeding requires nutrients from the mother. if she can't get enough food for both her and her baby, she won't be able to breastfeed whether she wants to or not. but ethically, as i said before, there's a difference between a living, breathing baby and a fetus.  one last question, do you actually understand what it's like to find out you only exist because your father raped your mother?",0,,

 nothing at all. the problem is that's not what special education does. sped takes a student, finds out what's ""wrong"" with them, and then tries to find ways to ""overcome"" this ""problems."" the best example i can give is what the deaf community has done at large. hearing aids and implants have recently become fairly advanced. however, much of the deaf community would scoff at the idea of getting one of them. they are insulting. the very fact of their existence implies that there is something ""wrong"" with being deaf. in many ways, getting a hearing implant is like throwing away a part of your identity. students with ld are equally broken down in school. they are constantly reminded of their deficits at every annual iep meeting. every single annual goal is based on an area where they are struggling. none of them focus on their strengths.  rti might change the way special education referrals happen, but for the most part, people are referred to special education because they see something ""wrong"" with them. in many cases this becomes a reason to separate the student from the general education classroom. today, special education is the only socially acceptable form of segregation in schools. 70 years ago, the exact same reasons people support separate race schools are the exact same reasons people support sped classes today. a belief in inferiority.  &gt;someone with downs or prader willi or a severe learning disability or an amputee who was injured in the war did not work themselves into their disability through bad choices, and they do not have the option to work their way out of their disability.  right, and i would argue that those people don't have anything to ""work out"" of. that's just who they are.  the only reason people see them as inferior in anyway is because they are trying to ""normalize"" them. if there is a guy that had his arm blown off by an iud, whatever, he doesn't need to just live his whole life trying to make up for his lost arm, he just needs to accept that it may be part of his identity now. not a negative, not a positive, it's just part of his being. it's just how you view yourself.  &gt;they do not have the opportunity the obese have to actually remove their disability through their own actions.   i don't deny that. but from a disability studies standpoint, i would argue that that is irrelevant. i agree that they can change themselves, but what obligation do they have to? some would say it's healthy, but then i ask what obligation do they have to be healthy? in the same way the deaf choose to remain deaf, can't the obese choose to remain obese?   &gt;the idea that these people would not take these steps is offensive. it seems like you might disagree.  yes, i would disagree. granted, i certainly don't disagree in the process of being healthy. i believe in being healthy. i avoid sugar, and hit the gym on a regular basis. but i don't find it ""offensive"" that others don't do the same. in fact, i find it offensive when people try to force health on others as a moral obligation. i would also argue that it's wrong to stop people from doing drugs or other actions that may be self-damaging, and i have no right to tell them how to live their lives.  &gt;why do you feel people should be able to make themselves unhealthy via lifestyle choices then be catered to?  i don't know if i agree with the last part. i don't think they should be ""catered to"" anymore than anyone else. i personally don't have an issue with airlines making the obese buy extra seats, as they use the extra space. i don't really want to address handicapped placards, as i feel that system is already kind of flawed. any government enforced model will be flawed. it really should be a ""hey, if you think you need the handicapped parking, take it, but don't be dick"" kind of model. maybe that's a bit lofty, but that's what i think.  i also think this might be a different issue in a country with universal healthcare, like canada. but in a country like the usa, that supposedly champions individuality, (myself included, which might make me a bit different from other scholars of critical theory), i think people should be able to be as obese as they want with no consequence.",1,,2

456016,"^^^^automod  ***this is a copy of the above post. it is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***  backstory:  started dating at 17.  a month later she tried to break up with me while i thought things were going well.  i drove to her house in the middle of the night to find out what she was so upset about.  turns out that she was pregnant.  we had only started having sex a couple of weeks prior.  my naive dumb ass asked if it was mine and of course it turns out she's pregnant by one of the biggest losers in school, her ex-boyfriend whom she dumped after realizing what a piece of shit he was.    (side note, this dude has 4 kids;  my step-daughter, her half-brother (adopted by a new awesome father), a child with down syndrome whom he had with this 40+yo wife who died in a car accident, and another girl who got pregnant and ran to washington state to get away from him.)  i digress.  the entire pregnancy was a nightmare.  the father would stir up drama every chance he got and caused nothing but problems.  tried to fight me at the nicu she was in for 3 months as she was born 2 months early, started rumors at school, confronted me, etc.  my father-in-law sat us both down and gave us this talk:  ""life is about pussy. . ."" basically made us shake hands and agree to be gentleman.  that didn't last long as he started stalking us.  also, while it was his weekend with the baby, we would see him at the mall by himself or with friends and no baby.  when asked, of course his parents were watching her.  fast forward many years of compulsive lying and general neglect, he calls cps...on us.  told his doctor we were putting cigarettes out on her which was in no shape or form true in any way.  she's a ""picker"" and had picked some bug bites or whatever and of course when you pick your wounds they look worse.  she still does it today.  we decided after all the drama and all the pain he's caused our beloved daughter that he didn't deserve to see her anymore.  the child support payments stopped immediately.  it's now been 7 years without a single payment, but this isn't about him.   my wife is a type 1 diabetic with multiple complications as a result of her not taking care of herself.  we have struggled to get her on any kind of insurance or coverage that would help her with her diabetes.  while i was in the army, she had tricare which was awesome and even left us with 6 months of supplies after the fact which was a life saver.  her complications go from being like 90% blind (maybe worse, eye appointment upcoming) - can't read the big e on the eye chart to missing toes to nerve damage to diabetic gastroparesis.  we are days apart (age 31) and she's suffering badly.  now, all that being said, she doesn't check her blood sugar regularly, doesn't take insulin properly, prefers to have a blood sugar &gt;200 as opposed to 100-200 where it's supposed to be because being ""low"" feels so much worse than a blood sugar high.  food?  psh.  anything fried or covered in sugar is her favorite.  donuts, french fries, burgers, anything sweet that isn't chocolate.  i know i don't help.  my diet sucks, i eat fast food constantly and i'm a little overweight and i love the sweets too.  here's the difference:  i know i eat like shit and i want to change it.  i've made several attempts to change my diet and excersize more only to fail over and over again.  i've managed to stick to a ""low-carb, high vegetable, low-fat"" diet for a few weeks at a time, during which she is awful.  complains constantly, never stops talking about ice cream or gummy bears.  when we were short on time one evening, i said ""hey, i'm going to burger king to get a salad...do you want one?"" - trying to at least nudge her in the general right direction.  'no, get me the triple double bacon with cheese and extra fries with a giant diet coke'.  i've tried this hundreds of times to convince her to eat right.  here's the thing, she's beautiful, gorgeous and far from fat.  i'm not trying to get her to eat right so she'll lose weight, i'm trying to get her to eat right to save her fucking life.  we've accumulated probably over $1,000,000 in hospital bills due to 9-10 emergency room visits a year.  when she gets sick, they usually keep her in the hospital at least a week and the recovery at home can be 2-4 weeks at which point the cycle starts over again where she's getting sick in that timeframe and right back in the hospital with an infection, dka, gastroparesis symptoms, etc.    &amp;#x200b;  we started couples counseling last year but it only lasted a couple of months.  i started therapy and seeing a medications-provider (pyschiatrist) at the same time.  i have va care so i can use all the healthcare options they have available including couples counseling but it does not include my wife's personal care.  during counseling last year (\~may 2018) our counselor asked to give our relationship 2 more months during counseling.  we did all kinds of ""homework"" like remembering how we felt when we were first together and all this emotional stuff, but, i don't think she understood(the therapist).  i love my wife.  deeply, strongly and faithfully.  i've never been unfaithful and i tell her everything.  she's the only person in the world i can literally be myself around and she won't hate me for it, at least that's how i feel.  but, i don't know if i explained everything right or what, but, my problems with my wife are tangible real problems, not emotional ones.  it was always difficult to get her in the mood for sex but now that she's been sick(3 years now), it's stopped pretty much completely.  when it does happen, it's awful for both of us.  i know that sex isn't everything so i've looked past that.  i've asked her at least 1,000 times to do any of the following:  a)  get a job, go to work, do something.  b)  apply for college, go back to school, get some student loans, etc.  c)  apply for disability.  if you're too sick to work, then you must be disabled.  with disability and/or a job comes health insurance, with health insurance you can see the doctors you need to see.  with doctors comes the inevitable healthier lifestyle and therefore positive changes in her health.  i gave the counselor the two months she asked for and i thought hard about my relationship for months, i'm still thinking about it.  that august, i told my wife that i had made my decision and i wanted to separate.  i told her that i wanted our daughter to finish 6th grade before we split up the family.  she just started middle school and is in band for the first time and she's really been struggling to find herself this year.  i love our daughter as much as i love my wife.  i have asked and begged and pleaded my wife not to take her away from me like we did her biological father.  she swears she's going to let me continue being her ""dad"" forever.  i have every intention of taking care of her until i'm incapable of doing so.  here's the dad thing too - we've lost 2 babies to miscarriage and had 1 early pregnancy loss during our 10+year relationship.  i have no biological children and that bothers me a lot.  she knows and we've never used protection, birth control, nor have i ever really pulled out.  we know that we shouldn't have more children because it would endanger her life but she wanted to give me a child and i wanted to give her one.  fortunately, now, that never happened.  it now appears that we will never conceive a child of our own nor will she ever do anything with her life nor will she ever be able to drive herself again nor will she be able to take care of her own daughter by herself.  in the last 2 years she's missed halloween, christmas, first period, thanksgiving...and more that i can't think of, because she was in the hospital.       i don't blame her for being a diabetic, i don't blame her for all of the things that ""just happened"" to her.  i do, however, blame her for her poor choices in taking care of herself.  i do blame her for not caring enough about her own life to get herself right for our daughter.  i have a small glimmer of hope, less than 1% chance, that she'll let our daughter stay with me when we separate.  i gave her almost an entire year to figure something out and here we are, 3 months away from the date that was set and she's worse now than last year instead of better.       tl;dr:  type 1 diabetic wife doesn't take care of herself, has serious complications from it, has no intentions of fixing anything or getting healthier and has been quoted as saying ""i just want to get her to 18"" (our daughter).  i'm letting her stay with me and i'm still taking care of her until may when we ""separate"" - probably followed by divorce.       aita?!  &amp;#x200b;  this is really hard for me to post because i have anxiety really bad and i think everyone is going to be angry at me.  i'm not a bad person, just in a bad situation and i don't see any other solution.  &amp;#x200b;  *i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/amitheasshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",1,,-1

894645,"**euphemisms**  *by george carlin*  i don't like words that hide the truth.  i don't words that conceal reality. i don't like euphemisms, or euphemistic language. and american english is loaded with euphemisms. cause americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality. americans have trouble facing the truth, so they invent the kind of a soft language to protest themselves from it, and it gets worse with every generation. for some reason, it just keeps getting worse. i'll give you an example of that. there's a condition in combat. most people know about it. it's when a fighting person's nervous system has been stressed to it's absolute peak and maximum. can't take anymore input. the nervous system has either (click) snapped or is about to snap. in the first world war, that condition was called shell shock . simple, honest, direct language. two syllables, shell shock . almost sounds like the guns themselves.   that was seventy years ago. then a whole generation went by and the second world war came along and very same combat condition was called battle fatigue . four syllables now. takes a little longer to say. doesn't seem to hurt as much. fatigue is a nicer word than shock. shell shock! battle fatigue. then we had the war in korea, 1950. madison avenue was riding high by that time, and the very same combat condition was called operational exhaustion. hey, were up to eight syllables now! and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase. it's totally sterile now. operational exhaustion. sounds like something that might happen to your car.   then of course, came the war in viet nam, which has only been over for about sixteen or seventeen years, and thanks to the lies and deceits surrounding that war, i guess it's no surprise that the very same condition was called post-traumatic stress disorder. still eight syllables, but we've added a hyphen! and the pain is completely buried under jargon. post-traumatic stress disorder. i'll bet you if we'd of still been calling it shell shock, some of those viet nam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time. i'll betcha. i'll betcha. but.  but, it didn't happen, and one of the reasons. one of the reasons is because we were using that soft language. that language that takes the life out of life. and it is a function of time. it does keep getting worse. i'll give you another example.   sometime during my life. sometime during my life, toilet paper became bathroom tissue. i wasn't notified of this. no one asked me if i agreed with it. it just happened. toilet paper became bathroom tissue. sneakers became running shoes. false teeth became dental appliances. medicine became medication. information became directory assistance. the dump became the landfill. car crashes became automobile accidents. partly cloudy bacame partly sunny. motels became motor lodges. house trailers became mobile homes. used cars became previously owned transportation. room service became guest-room dining. and constipation became occasional irregularity. when i was a little kid, if i got sick they wanted me to go to the hospital and see a doctor. now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization...or a wellness center to consult a healthcare delivery professional. poor people used to live in slums. now the economically disadvantaged occupy substandard housing in the inner cities. and they're broke! they're broke! they don't have a negative cash-flow position. they're fucking broke! cause a lot of them were fired. you know, fired. management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area, so many people are no longer viable members of the workforce. smug, greedy, well-fed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins.  it's as simple as that. the cia doesn't kill anybody anymore, they neutralize people...or they depopulate the area. the government doesn't lie, it engages in disinformation. the pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation in something they call sunshine units. israeli murderers are called commandos. arab commandos are called terrorists. contra killers are called freedom fighters. well, if crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire, what do freedom fighters fight? they never mention that part of it to us, do they? never mention that part of it. and...and some of this stuff is just silly, we all know that, like on the airlines, they say want to pre- board.  well, what the hell is pre-board, what does that mean? to get on before you get on? they say they're going to pre-board those passengers in need of special assistance. cripples! simple honest direct language. there is no shame attached to the word cripple that i can find in any dictionary. no shame attached to it, in fact it's a word used in bible translations. jesus healed the cripples. doesn't take seven words to describe that condition. but we don't have any cripples in this country anymore. we have the physically challenged . is that a grotesque enough evasion for you? how about differently abled . i've heard them called that. differently abled! you can't even call these people handicapped anymore. they'll say, ""were not handicapped. were handicapable!"" these poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition, somehow you'll change the condition. well, hey cousin, ppsssspptttttt. doesn't happen. doesn't happen. we have no more deaf people in this country, hearing impaired.  no ones blind anymore, partially sighted or visually impaired. we have no more stupid people. everyone has a learning disorder...or he's minimally exceptional. how would you like to be told that about your child? ""he's minimally exceptional."" ""oohh, thank god for that."" psychologists actually have started calling ugly people, those with severe appearance deficits. it's getting so bad, that any day now i expect to hear a rape victim referred to as an unwilling sperm recipient. and we have no more old people in this country.  no more old people. we shipped them all away, and we brought in these senior citizens . isn't that a typically american twentieth century phrase? bloodless, lifeless, no pulse in one of them. a senior citizen . but i've accepted that one, i've come to terms with it. i know it's to stay. we'll never get rid of it. that's what they're going to be called, so i'll relax on that, but the one i do resist. the one i keep resisting is when they look at an old guy and they'll say, ""look at him dan! he's ninety years young."" imagine the fear of aging that reveals. to not even be able to use the word ""old"" to describe somebody. to have to use an antonym. and fear of aging is natural. it's universal. isn't it? we all have that. no one wants to get old. no one wants to die, but we do!   so we bullshit ourselves. i started bullshitting myself when i got to my forties. as soon as i got into my forties i'd look in the mirror and i'd say, ""well, i...i guess i'm getting...older."" older sounds a little better than old doesn't it? sounds like it might even last a little longer. bullshit, i'm getting old! and it's okay, because thanks to our fear of death in this country, i won't have to die...i'll pass away. or i'll expire like a magazine subscription. if it happens in the hospital, they'll call it a terminal episode. the insurance company will refer to it as negative patient-care outcome. and if it's the result of malpractice, they'll say it was a therapeutic misadventure.   i'm telling you, some of this language makes me want to vomit. well, maybe not vomit. makes me want to engage in an involuntary personal protein spill.",1,,2

261560,"imo, normally disabilities + magic/ other abilities get treated in a few ways.  type one: the magic/ other ability actually makes the person 'abled' in a sense. a good example of this is toph beifong in avatar the last airbender, who is blind but who can 'sense' the world through her feet and who becomes one of the greatest earthbenders in the world. a similar example is daredevil, who is also blind, yet has such good hearing (i think) plus other senses that he is essentially, like toph, abled. i kind of call this the 'canceled out' type because their ability/ magic system cancels out their disability to an extent.  type two: the person has both magic/ supernatural/ superhuman abilities but is still disabled. a prime example of this type is professor x from x-men. he's born a powerful telepath however loses the use of his legs at one point. his telepathy doesn't make him more abled -- he's still disabled because he can't use his legs. hawkeye is another example -- he is deaf and he is a great archer, his superior archery skills don't negate his deafness.  however, it's also interesting how blindness or paralysis is often paired with a mental ability that gives the user more knowledge. when bran becomes paralysed in game of thrones he becomes a 'greenseer' and there's also the archetype of the blind seer. blindness specifically is normally paired with the mental sense, or else the blind person is a superhuman fighter, like toph, daredevil, the blind guy in rogue one (i haven't watched it but i saw the trailers). neurodivergent and/ or mentally ill people also normally have mental gifts like prophecy, telepathy, etc. or if they're neurodivergent are sometimes super intelligent.  then there's the third type: superpower disability (which is what tv tropes calls it) and is when a person's superpower directly gives them some type of disability/ difference that hinders them socially, physically, and/ or mentally. the x-men comics does this tons specifically because the themes presented in x-men were/ are about diversity, prejudice, and discrimination. to me this can be split into a further three groups:  \-- aesthetic differences, like different skin, hair, or eye colours, that make the mutants stand out/ look different (mystique has blue skin and yellow eyes; azazel has red skin; polaris has green hair)  \-- aesthetic + structural differences, which includes differences you can see but are also differences that changes how a person interacts with the world/ what they can do (nightcrawler has a tail and also has three instead of five fingers; angel has wings; toad has a longer tongue; wolverine has bone claws, sabretooth has claws)  \-- power issue, which to me is when an aspect of the power makes the power makes it a disability (rogue can't turn her power off so whenever she touches people she uses her power on them; cyclops has the same issue as rogue, he can't turn his power off so he has to wear special glasses in order to see without frying people with lasers)  personally, i don't like type one/ when a character's disability is negated by their powers. especially if they gain these powers as a result of a disability/ after they're disabled. it's kind of like queer baiting, except it's disability baiting. not in all cases though, but i feel like if you have a character with a disability, make consequences for this.  i would recommend searching up more about this online. i had a period where i came across the same thing as you and was wondering. from what i read, a lot of people said they would stick with their illness and not cure it, while i'm sure other people, including myself, would gladly get rid of an illness. but then it depends on the illness and on the person as well. people who are paralyzed may answer differently than people who have a chronic pain disease, and so on. some illnesses are also more noticed/recognized by the public and have more funding as well. people literally die in america because of diabetes and a lot of people think it's a 'fat person disease' or you only get it when you're fat, or there's only one type of diabetes. likewise, some illnesses/ disabilities are more stigmatized than others, like schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder are more stigmatized than generalized anxiety disorder or depression. likewise, aids is more stigmatized than a whole lot of disorders and tons of people don't know about aids. some illnesses - like diabetes - are also invisible, whereas other ones are quite visible/ affect how a person looks or their bones or stuff like that. likewise, people who were born with a disability/ illness would likely answer differently than to someone who had gained a disability in their life. how the person became disabled would most likely factor in to whether they would keep it or not. and, if the disorder/ disability is genetic could also affect how they answer as well. so, in short, i think it comes down to the person and their relationship with their disorder.  however, i think it's also interesting to mention how super powered/ magically endowed individuals are doubly disabled but also super powerful? like, i'm not gonna say that professor x isn't disabled because his telepathy negates his disability, like he still can't walk. but he can read minds, he can control people's minds, if anything others are disabled/ disadvantaged compared to him, you know? like he is privileged compared to other people in a sense? for instance, i have a character who is a woman and who is super strong. she realises she has more privilege than a lot of other women (and people) because she doesn't have to worry about people inflicting violence upon her, because she'll be able to beat them. she doesn't have to worry about walking home alone at night, and in every situation with others, she know she'll always win in a physical altercation/ can back her words up with a fight. idk, it's like all the x men movies were like 'mutants and humans should be equal! humans shouldn't be afraid of mutants!' when it's like? it kind of makes sense why humans are afraid of mutants. some mutants can kill people, control people, control the environment way easier than a normal human, and some have powers that are impossible to control/ turn off. idk, i just feel like it's a thing that's not really explored.",1,,1

[here](http://fosterhood.tumblr.com/post/190497163/declining-this-baby-was-one-of-the-hardest-things-ive) is the relevant post of a foster mother who herself was adopted, and experiences it from both sides of the equation.      i don't disagree that it's an incredibly difficult and personal process (which i hope you can understand is why i have such a strong reaction) but i disagree with the notion that you're not good enough for a mildly disabled child. becoming a parent is a huge decision, and adoption presents it's own unique set of challenges- for instance, if you birthed it, you wouldn't likely give up a child for having say, partial deafness, but you're less apt to select that child, given the choice. i just can't see why someone would not even put thought into adopting them on an individual basis, and categorically refuse any disability. doesn't mean it's not the common thing to do. you yourself, who seem really down to earth, have expressed that you wouldn't feel comfortable taking a disabled child- why make such a broad generalization, and miss out on a potentially amazing child?   it may be because i have the shit end of the genetic lottery, but i cannot see writing off an entire group of children for any reason. individually, i can assess why or why not they would mesh with my family, but i know i turned out well despite being kinda blind and gimpy. i wouldn't want someone to refuse to consider me solely because i have trouble doing a few things the same way as a ""normal"" people can.",1,,1

(this doesn't even take into account how a lot of girls who are neurodivergent aren't diagnosed until adulthood because of the assumptions about what it looks like because until recently studies focused on boys).  in ontario as well the special education standards do not take mental health into consideration when it comes to accommodations, it only takes ""behavioural concerns"" - so students have to rise to the level of being a concern to others to have their needs met.  most schools are not physically accessible. the aoda training for staff is woefully inadequate. and while it is now being pushed more as a good course to take - it's not a requirement to even take special education 1 to get your teachers degree, even though every single teacher is guaranteed to have a student come through their class with an iep.  i can't speak as much to supports in universities, because i focused on k-12. but i can give anecdotal information about how a friend of mine has been forced to delay going back to get her masters for probably a year because she is having serious issues getting the supports she needs in place to do it, because of beaurocratic problems and delays.  i never said anything about people being able to be surgeons, or pilots. at this point we're literally talking jobs and careers and supports and programs that mean not living in poverty, and not living in ever worsening conditions (jesus christ the state my best friends autistic brother lives in is just upsetting on so many levels because he's just been failed by the system his entire life)  i also never said you shouldn't help kids in figuring out how to interact with allistic peole. but maybe also you need to consider that allistic people need to learn to interact with autistic people, disabled people, and deaf people. seeing as you're all so capable, why can't you put a little more effort in there? it's not hard to learn that not making eye contact isn't rude, it's not hard to learn that just because someone walks or talks different it doesn't mean they have a low iq, it's not hard to learn some sign language.  i'm not even going to pick apart your comments about advocating funding going to not the best causes just because of your interests because it's so incredibly fucking selfish and ableist. you actually should be ashamed of yourself. same with your comments about having babies. jfc. i am sick, and i just don't have the mental capacity right now to unpack how ableist that comment is (but jsyk, there are a number of autistic parents out there, and autistic parents with autistic children. and disabled parents make for way fucking better parents to disabled children on the whole. i should know, i'm a child of one, and i had it way better than most of my other disabled friends growing up).",1,-2,-1

504463,"i spent many years caring for quadriplegic males and this is a huge area to get into. a great deal of the variables depend on where along the spinal cord the damage occurred. i have cared for men who could only move their heads slightly and other people who have some movement in their arms. it is a misnomer that quadriplegics cannot move their limbs at all. it means that they have impaired function in all four limbs. however i've never come across any quadriplegic who wasn't fully incontinent. managing this aspect of their care is almost a full time job in itself. all the men i cared for had a catheter to manage the urinary incontinence. so it's just a matter of emptying that regularly and maintaining the catheter itself. bowels can be more difficult for the client. the person will usually have trouble with constipation because of the fact that the intestinal functions that move the feces along the colon to the outside either don't occur or are severely limited. so most are on a fairly large dose of some kind of laxative and/or stool softener. the regular use of suppositories to bring on a bowel movement is also very common. that way a routine can be established to encourage the person to have a bowel movement say every second morning before their shower as an example. abdominal massage is also used commonly by nurses/carers to help move the intestinal contents along the gi tract. so even though the person can't tell when they need to go to the rest room, all these things establish what is known as ""social continence"". this means that the person is still unable to control their bowels themselves, but with an effective and well maintained toileting regime accidents are hugely reduced. however most people will still wear some kind of continence aid (eg. adult diapers), just in case. then there are other people who end up with a colostomy bag. so it's not in their hands at all.  the whole sex and babies thing is even more complicated and very variable depending on the level of injury. ""reflex"" erections (through touch) occur at the sacral level and can still occur in those men with incomplete lower injuries. others achieve ""psychogenic"" erections achieved through watching pornography or by thinking about sex. orgasm and ejaculation is usually not possible in those with complete lower injury. however these men can still enjoy the relaxation and emotional well-being that comes with engaging in sexual activity and making their partner orgasm. let's just say i've never come across a quadriplegic man with a paralyzed tongue! some men who can't achieve an erection will use a strap-on so that they can simulate intercourse with a partner, usually with the woman on top. and as far as fertility goes, spinal injury does not usually make a man not produce sperm, but it can affect the motility (ability to move) of the sperm. so to impregnate a partner most men will need some kind of medical intervention such as sperm extraction and invitro fertilization.   note: this information relates only to quadriplegics who have suffered a spinal cord injury. some quadriplegics suffer from a condition such as spasticity or cerebral palsy which impairs all four limbs and not a spinal cord injury. i do not have enough experience in caring for these clients to speak on the subject. maybe someone else can.  edit: after re-reading your question i just wanted to add something. you asked how men who became disabled after they get married can have kids. believe me, there are plenty of guys who are quadriplegics before they get married. unless they suffered some kind of brain damage along with the spinal injury, quadriplegia does not impair a person's ability to love, be loved or emotionally maintain a normal adult relationship. yes, it can make things more difficult in many areas, but human beings are amazingly adaptable. especially where true love is involved!",1,,1
810318,"&gt; are there special schools as in germany?  yes there are. typically a student is only sent to such a school in extreme cases; cases where the public school cannot possibly meet the students' needs. students in my district have been sent to schools that specialize in students who are deaf or blind, or schools for students with emotional/behavioral problems so severe they cannot learn in a regular school.  &gt; are special needs children included into regular schools?  yes they are. it's federal law that if a student *can* be included in a regular school, that they are.   &gt; what support structures are in place for teachers who have special needs children in their classroom?  in my experience, learning about how to include students with disabilities is part of teacher training. sometimes a teacher will co-teach with a special educator. every student in special education has an individualized education plan (iep) that can tell a teacher what the student's current academic levels are and what interventions work best, as well as what accommodations or modifications the student needs to be successful in a regular classroom. an iep team meets at least every year to keep all of this up to date. that team is probably the most important structure in place for students with disabilities.   &gt; are kids with disabilities such as autism, down syndrom, blind kids for example always in the same classrooms?  i think your asking if students with disabilities are *always in the regular classroom*? no they're not. but they're in the regular classroom *as much as possible*. students might spend time in a resource room or alternative classroom depending on their needs. for example, i have students who take all regular classes, but spend their study hall with me getting basic reading skills instruction. sometimes students who need an alternative curriculum in say, math, will take that class separately but spend the rest of their time with their non-disabled peers. sometimes a special educator can even come into the regular classroom and teach to students who need it. there are a variety of models and levels of intervention for students with disabilities, and a team that includes regular teachers, special educators, parents, etc. are the ones who make that decision on a student-by-student basis.   &gt; how do the special needs kids integrate into their classes?  it really depends on the student and what their level of need is. there are students who are the same level as their classmates, given accommodations, who integrate seamlessly. some students may work in the same room, but on an alternative curriculum, and interact with their classmates occasionally. other students may spend a majority of their time outside the regular classroom, and only do certain activities (lunch, recess, special classes like art/pe/etc.) with their peers for the sake of socialization.   &gt; do they get along wiht classmates? is there bullying or exclusion?  it depends on the student. being associated with special education does carry some negative connotations in the us; the term sped is shorthand for ""retard"" among many students. there's bullying to the extent that any person with a disability is a potential target. but i would say for the most part, students with disabilities, when they are included with their non-disabled peers, develop very positive relationships.   &gt; how do you feel about the system?  i like our system a lot. we've come a long way as a nation in our treatment of individuals with disabilities. what i think is best is that decisions are made on a case-by-case basis; students with disabilities are no longer lumped all together like they were one homogeneous group.",1,,1

301525,"the nazis had implemented a program targeting the mentally ill and physically disabled long before there were public decrees making it a noted part of society- they called this program 'operation t4' and it operated, as i stated, as a precursor to the concentration camps.            quoting: http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/disabilities/             'on july 14, 1933, the german government instituted the ‚Äúlaw for the prevention of progeny with hereditary diseases.‚Äù this law called for the sterilization of all persons who suffered from diseases considered hereditary, including mental illness, learning disabilities, physical deformity, epilepsy, blindness, deafness, and severe alcoholism. **with the law‚Äôs passage the third reich also stepped up its propaganda against the disabled, regularly labeling them ‚Äúlife unworthy of life‚Äù or ‚Äúuseless eaters‚Äù and highlighting their burden upon society.**            the term ‚Äúeuthanasia‚Äù (literally, ‚Äúgood death‚Äù) usually refers to the inducement of a painless death for a chronically or terminally ill individual. in nazi usage, however, ‚Äúeuthanasia‚Äù referred to the systematic killing of the institutionalized mentally and physically disabled. the secret operation was code-named t4, in reference to the street address (tiergartenstrasse 4) of the program's coordinating office in berlin.          ashes from cremated victims were taken from a common pile and placed in urns without regard for accurate labeling. one urn was sent to each victim's family, along with a death certificate listing a fictive cause and date of death. the sudden death of thousands of institutionalized people, whose death certificates listed strangely similar causes and places of death, raised suspicions. eventually, the euthanasia program became an open secret.               on august 18, 1939, the reich ministry of the interior circulated a decree compelling all physicians, nurses, and midwives to report newborn infants and children under the age of three who showed signs of severe mental or physical disability. at first only infants and toddlers were incorporated in the effort, but eventually juveniles up to 17 years of age were also killed. conservative estimates suggest that at least 5,000 physically and mentally disabled children were murdered through starvation or lethal overdose of medication.              also, (quoting:)  http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/books/detail.php?content=2001-05-16        '**the origins of nazi genocide** traces the mass exterminations of jews and other victim groups back to the first secretive murder of a handicapped child in a state-run euthanasia clinic.             with little popular opposition, the killing of the handicapped evolved into the final solution, the methods of euthanasia foreshadowing the extermination of millions.  the third reich labeled those of its citizens who deviated from the physical ‚Äúaryan‚Äù ideal through congenital illness as ‚Äúlife unworthy of life‚Äù and a threat to ‚Äúrace hygiene.‚Äù these included the blind, deaf, epileptic, physically deformed, chronically ill, and the mentally impaired.'          also: persecuting the mentally ill and disabled:    http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/holocaust/disabled.html          t-4 program: http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/holocaust/t4toc.html           etc, etc. at any rate, i didn't want to cause a 'race for the most victimized competition' to occur- my point for the most part was that society is so ignorant of the initial persecution and killings of the mentally ill and disabled, that they discount them as important in the history lesson.",1,,0

402429,"elena grew up a talkative child. her parents even suspected she might have adhd, but no, they just had a loud, animated, perpetually yammering kid. she would go on and on about a show she'd watched, a person she'd seen on the side of the road, a toy she'd seen her friends play with she just *had* to have, mom, please. her teachers, growing tired of her endless chatter, would send her on long errands, which made her close friends with every admin person at her school, who knew to nod and smile at her rambling. words poured as if her brain was a broken faucet, almost beyond her control.  at ten years old, elena went to the park with her friend lisa to ride their new bikes around the court. their moms were nearby, cooing at elena's new baby brother, brody. he was a tiny, puckered, ugly little thing, but she'd loved him instantly. she would talk about him constantly. lisa would just let elena chatter. she was a quiet kid, and they fit together just fine. they ended up playing around with a couple of other kids they met at the park. they couldn't find the kids' parents anywhere, but the kids wore weird outfits and could do cool handstands, so elena and lisa thought nothing of it.  they'd been playing for an hour when elena accidentally crashed hard into one of the kids - a blond, waifish little thing with barely there eyebrows and crystal blue eyes. the boy turned around, visibly upset.  ""i'm sorry!"" elena started, ""i lost control of my bike. but you really shouldn't stand around like that, you know! my mom always tells me-""  ""silence, child.""  elena froze. lisa and the other children were on the other side of the court. lisa looked her way, but couldn't hear them. she couldn't hear the child's voice turn deep, rumble out of his tiny chest.  ""what... you're a child too!""  the boy lifted a hand, steady and slow, aiming it at her face with purpose. he was silent, angry, frowning deeply as his fingers contorted in front of her mouth. elena felt a shiver run up her body, shaking her like she just got off the roller coaster at the local fair. she stared back, paralyzed, her hands clutching the handlebar of her bike. something in his eyes snapped, and he looked distraught, confused.  the boy then lowered his hand, visibly worried with his lips pursed tight, turned, and ran into the park, disappearing behind the path. the other three children followed suit, not even looking back.  lisa came back to her, confused. ""what was that?""  ""i-"" elena was nearly struck dumb. she was never without words, but she had none. what would she say, that the child raising a hand in front of her face made her whole world tilt sideways?  lisa's brows furrowed. ""mom!"" she called out, still looking at elena.  ""what?"" lisa's mom yelled back.  ""some kid was weird with elena!"" lisa replied.  elena's mom beckoned them over with one hand, the other holding brody.  ""elena, did you say something to that kid?"" her mom asked, exasperated.  normally, elena was used to people thinking she'd annoyed someone, put her foot in her mouth with her endless talking. but this angered her. the whole world was wrong now, couldn't her mom see that?  ""i didn't mom, i didn't!"" elena insisted.  her mom crinkled her nose skeptically. ""well, they're gone now, and i need to get your brother to nap if you want any ice cream later.""  elena fumed. she loved brody, but she hated how her mom would do this. brody this, brody that. he always needed something, and when he did, elena needed to not need anything.  ""to hell with stupid brody!"" she fumed.  her mom gasped at her, and she could feel lisa and her mom's eyes on her too.  what happened next was worse.  the sky instantly turned red. it was one blink blue, one blink red. the clouds burned with fire. the trees of the park disappeared, replaced with barren rocks covered in black tar. an enormous face looked down from the sky, smiling a gaping, magma filled grin.  lisa screamed. her mom held her tight, falling to her knees at her side. elena's mom tightened her grip on brody, her eyes huge, her face pallid and shocked.  elena looked up at the smiling face, with its hollow black eyes like giant black holes.  ""as you wish,"" a booming voice rumbled, shaking the tar off of the rocks, raising the fires of the sky. she know it was speaking directly to her.  a hand made of coal reached down, straight to her mom. before they could even blink, the hand grabbed brody's onesie, yanking him out of her mother's arms.  ""brody!"" her mom yelled, anguished, jumping up into the sky.  brody was yanked up, up, his cry of distress disappearing with him.  they all blinked once. the park returned to normal.  brody was gone.  and elena was now mute.  \--  for the next ten years, elena never spoke in front of another person. her parents had sent her to boarding schools, unable to look at her, struck with grief. she never quite fit in into any of them. too quiet, they'd say she was, antisocial. she needed ""special education"". her parents divorced just a year after brody was taken, as elena's father refused to believe her mother and blamed her for brody's sudden disappearance, while her mother blamed her. her dad remained the only contact she had, but that was nearly gone by the time she'd turned eighteen and started working for a small charity that catered to people like her, as well as people with deafness, blindness and learning disabilities. she could speak sign now, but she never used it. she famously only responded with nods. yes and no. she figured people probably assumed she had some kind of mental disability.  more like a mental super ability.  she knew this by the time she was twenty, for certain.  the first time she'd tried it was shortly after brody vanished. she sat in her room, staring at a wall as she'd been doing often recently.  ""the wall is purple,"" she whispered.  the wall turned a vibrant purple with her next blink.  the second time she'd tried it, she was a teenager. she looked at a boy she liked, wondering. curious.  ""he likes me,"" she whispered.  he confessed to her the next day, shy and sweet and utterly wrong. she mercifully wished his affections away the same day.  the third time, she was alone after a late night grocery run. she saw a man stalking a woman to her car in the dark parking lot. the woman was petrified.  ""he is turning away,"" she whispered.  the man stopped in his tracks. he turned away.  but elena wasn't done.  ""he's dead,"" she whispered.  the man dropped like a fish out of water. the parking lot was dark and quiet as the woman sped away.  she'd wondered then, what happened if someone suddenly knew, and was actually believed? her mother was deemed crazy, erratic. but find someone with enough influence, and they could convince someone to take her away. no thank you, she figured.  she was no hero. her heart sped up when the man dropped to the floor, soaring with delight. as a child, she had so many words, but they made no impact. they were chatter, out into the universe like grains of invisible sand.  now, her every word had power. sitting in her cheap little car in this desolate parking lot, elena knew she had the world in the palm of her hand, and that she probably shouldn't.  so elena stayed mute.",1,,-1

[**terminology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intellectual_disability#terminology) of article  [**intellectual disability**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intellectual%20disability): [](#sfw)   ---  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;  &gt;terms that denote mental deficiency have been subjected to the [euphemism treadmill.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euphemism_treadmill) the several traditional terms that long predate [psychiatry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychiatry) are simple forms of abuse in common usage today; they are often encountered in such old documents as books, academic papers, and [census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/census) forms (for example, the british census of 1901 has a column heading including the terms *imbecile* and *[feeble-minded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feeble-minded)*).  &gt;negative connotations associated with these numerous terms for intellectual disability reflect society's attitude about the condition. some elements of society seek neutral medical terms, while others want to use such terms as weapons of abuse.  &gt;today, new words like *special* or *challenged* are replacing the term *retarded*. the term *developmental delay* is popular among caretakers and parents of individuals with intellectual disability because *delay* suggests that a person is slowly reaching his or her full potential rather than being disabled. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:citation_needed)*]  &gt;usage has changed over the years and differed from country to country. for example, *mental retardation* in some contexts covers the whole field but previously applied to what is now the mild mr group. *feeble-minded* used to mean mild mr in the uk, and once applied in the us to the whole field. ""[borderline intellectual functioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borderline_intellectual_functioning)"" is not currently defined, but the term may be used to apply to people with iqs in the 70s. people with iqs of 70 to 85 used to be eligible for special consideration in the us public education system on grounds of intellectual disability. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:citation_needed)*]  &gt;   &gt;* __cretin__ is the oldest and comes from a dialectal french word for christian.  the implication was that people with significant intellectual or developmental disabilities were ""still human"" (or ""still christian"") and deserved to be treated with basic [human dignity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_dignity). individuals with the condition were considered to be incapable of sinning, thus ""christ-like"" in their disposition. this term is not used in scientific endeavors since the middle of the 20th century and is generally considered a term of abuse. although *cretin* is no longer in use, the term *[cretinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cretinism)* is still used to refer to the mental and physical disability resulting from untreated [congenital hypothyroidism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congenital_hypothyroidism).  &gt;* __amentia__ has a long history, mostly associated with dementia. the difference between amentia and dementia was originally defined by time of onset. *amentia* was the term used to denote an individual who developed deficits in mental functioning early in life, while *dementia* included individuals who develop mental deficiencies as adults. during the 1890s, *amentia* meant someone who was born with mental deficiencies. by 1912, ament was a classification lumping ""idiots, imbeciles, and feeble minded"" individuals in a category separate from a dement classification, in which the onset is later in life.  &gt;* __[idiot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/idiot_(usage\))__ indicated the greatest degree of intellectual disability, where the [mental age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mental_age) is two years or less, and the person cannot guard himself or herself against common physical dangers. the term was gradually replaced by the term __profound mental retardation__ (which has itself since been replaced by other terms).  &gt;* __[imbecile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imbecile)__ indicated an intellectual disability less extreme than idiocy and not necessarily inherited. it is now usually subdivided into two categories, known as __severe intellectual disability__ and __moderate intellectual disability__.  &gt;* __[moron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moron_(psychology\))__ was defined by the american association for the study of the [feeble-minded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feeble-minded) in 1910, following work by [henry h. goddard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_h._goddard), as the term for an [adult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adult) with a [mental age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mental_age) between eight and twelve; __mild intellectual disability__ is now the term for this condition. alternative definitions of these terms based on iq were also used. this group was known in uk law from 1911 to 1959/60 as *feeble-minded*.  &gt;* __mongolism__ was a medical term used to identify someone with [down syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/down_syndrome). the [mongolian people's republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongolian_people%27s_republic) requested that the medical community cease use of the term as a referent to intellectual disability. their request was granted in the 1960s, when the world health organization agreed that the term should cease being used within the medical community.  &gt;* in the field of [special education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_education), __educable__ (or ""educable intellectual disability"") refers to id students with iqs of approximately 50‚Äì75 who can progress academically to a late elementary level. __trainable__ (or ""trainable intellectual disability"") refers to students whose iqs fall below 50 but who are still capable of learning [personal hygiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hygiene) and other living skills in a sheltered setting, such as a group home. in many areas, these terms have been replaced by use of ""moderate"" and ""severe"" intellectual disability. while the names change, the meaning stays roughly the same in practice.  &gt;* __retarded__ comes from the latin *retardare*, ""to make slow, delay, keep back, or hinder,"" so *mental retardation* meant the same as *mentally delayed*. the term was recorded in 1426 as a ""fact or action of making slower in movement or time."" the first record of retarded in relation to being mentally slow was in 1895. the term *retarded* was used to replace terms like *idiot*, *moron*, and *imbecile* because *retarded* was not then a derogatory term. by the 1960s, however, the term had taken on a partially derogatory meaning as well. the noun *retard* is particularly seen as pejorative; as of 2010, the [special olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_olympics), [best buddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/best_buddies) and over 100 other organizations are striving to eliminate the use of the ""r-word"" (analogous to the ""[n-word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nigger#the_n-word_euphemism)"") in everyday conversation.   the term *mental retardation* was a diagnostic term denoting the group of disconnected categories of mental functioning such as *[idiot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/idiot)*, *[imbecile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imbecile)*, and *[moron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moron_(psychology\))* derived from early iq tests, which acquired [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pejorative) connotations in popular discourse. the term *mental retardation* acquired negative and shameful connotations over the last few decades due to the use of the words *retarded* and *retard* as insults. this may have contributed to its replacement with euphemisms such as *mentally challenged* or *intellectually disabled*. while *[developmental disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/developmental_disability)* includes many other disorders (see below), *developmental disability* and *developmental delay* (for people under the age of 18), are generally considered more polite terms than *mental retardation*.  &gt;   &gt;* in [north america](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_america) intellectual disability is subsumed into the broader term *[developmental disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/developmental_disability)*, which also includes [epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epilepsy), [autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autism), [cerebral palsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cerebral_palsy) and other disorders that develop during the developmental period (birth to age 18). because service provision is tied to the designation 'developmental disability', it is used by many parents, direct support professionals, and physicians. in the united states, however, in school-based settings, the more specific term *mental retardation* or, more recently (and preferably), *intellectual disability*, is still typically used, and is one of 13 categories of disability under which children may be identified for special education services under public law 108-446.  &gt;* the phrase *intellectual disability* is increasingly being used as a synonym for people with significantly below-average cognitive ability. these terms are sometimes used as a means of separating general intellectual limitations from specific, limited deficits as well as indicating that it is not an emotional or psychological disability. *intellectual disability* may also refer to the outcome of [traumatic brain injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/traumatic_brain_injury), [lead poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lead_poisoning), or [dementing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dementing) conditions such as [alzheimer's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alzheimer%27s_disease). it is not specific to congenital disorders such as [down syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/down_syndrome).  &gt;the ""american association on mental retardation"" continued to use the term *mental retardation* until 2006.  in june 2006 its members voted to change the name of the organization to the ""[american association on intellectual and developmental disabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_association_on_intellectual_and_developmental_disabilities),"" rejecting the options to become the aaid or aadd. part of the rationale for the double name was that many members worked with people with [pervasive developmental disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pervasive_developmental_disorder), most of whom do not have intellectual disability.   &gt;in the uk, *mental handicap* had become the common medical term, replacing *mental subnormality* in scotland and *mental deficiency* in england and wales, until [stephen dorrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stephen_dorrell), [secretary of state for health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secretary_of_state_for_health) for the united kingdom from 1995‚Äì97, changed the [nhs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_health_service)'s designation to *[learning disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/learning_disability).*  the new term is not yet widely understood, and is often taken to refer to problems affecting schoolwork (the american usage), which are known in the uk as ""learning difficulties."" british [social workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_work) may use ""learning difficulty"" to refer to both people with mr and those with conditions such as [dyslexia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dyslexia).  in education, ""learning difficulties"" is applied to a wide range of conditions: ""specific learning difficulty"" may refer to [dyslexia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dyslexia), [dyscalculia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dyscalculia) or [developmental coordination disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/developmental_coordination_disorder), while ""moderate learning difficulties"", ""severe learning difficulties"" and ""profound learning difficulties"" refer to more significant impairments.    &gt;in england and wales between 1983 and 2008 the [mental health act 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mental_health_act_1983) defined ""mental impairment"" and ""severe mental impairment"" as ""...a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind which includes significant/severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning and is associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned.""  as behavior was involved, these were not necessarily permanent conditions: they were defined for the purpose of authorizing detention in hospital or guardianship. the term *mental impairment* was removed from the act in november 2008, but the grounds for detention remained. however, english statute law uses *mental impairment* elsewhere in a less well-defined manner‚Äî*e.g.* to allow exemption from taxes‚Äîimplying that intellectual disability without any behavioral problems is what is meant.  &gt;a [bbc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bbc) poll conducted in the united kingdom came to the conclusion that 'retard' was the most offensive disability-related word.  on the reverse side of that, when a contestant on [celebrity big brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celebrity_big_brother_2010_(uk\)) live used the phrase ""walking like a retard"", despite complaints from the public and the charity [mencap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mencap), the communications regulator [ofcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ofcom) did not uphold the complaint saying ""it was not used in an offensive context [...] and had been used light-heartedly"". it was however noted that two previous similar complaints from other shows were upheld.   &gt;in the past, australia has used british and american terms interchangeably, including ""mental retardation"" and ""mental handicap"". today, ""intellectual disability"" is the preferred and more commonly used descriptor.   &gt;  ---  ^interesting:

853178,"edit: thanks for the dowvnote, but could you at least include an answer to my questions along with it?  first off, full disclosure, i saw this thread elsewhere on reddit and came to ask you some questions because the concept is interesting but one i don't fully understand. i'm telling you this so you know i'm not really used to discussing disabilities, so if i misuse words or fail to grasp simple concepts i might need a layman's definition or a swat with a newspaper. :) i should also explain some significant bias i have before i ask my questions: i'm formerly morbidly obese and my life has improved in so many ways through weight loss that it altered my entire life course and i'm now in school for dietetics, intending to focus on helping morbidly obese clients manage their weight.  anyways, here are my questions if you have a moment:  * what is the problem with normalization of people in sped? perhaps i misunderstand the types of people we're talking about, or what normalization is, but my understanding is this is the attempt to help children and young adults of various functional capacity live closer to normal lives; that is, to help them function as non-disabled people do as much as can be expected given their disability. if i understand that correctly i fail to see why that's problematic, and i would love for you to explain to me why it is a problem in the eyes of some. people, of course, shouldn't be pushed beyond what they are functionally capable of in the name of living a ""normal"" life, because some people just won't ever be able to, but if you can work with a child to help them be as self-sufficient as possible it can help the child gain self-esteem and confidence and can take some stress off the care-giver. in short: what possible problem can be seen in empowering people to lead more capable lives?  * someone with downs or prader willi or a severe learning disability or an amputee who was injured in the war did not work themselves into their disability through bad choices, and they do not have the option to work their way out of their disability. they can, to varying degrees, find ways to adapt and cope, but they do not have the opportunity the obese have to actually remove their disability through their own actions. the idea that these people would *not* take these steps is offensive. it seems like you *might* disagree. if so, just an opinion question here, why do you feel people should be able to make themselves unhealthy via lifestyle choices then be catered to?

515138,"so there have been some remarkable advances in longevity research over the past decade which go relatively unknown by the public! technically, we already know how to achieve immortality. what we don't know however, is how to not die from things other than old age. to put it simply (because this is not an area of my expertise), telomeres are a sequence at the end of the chromosome that protect it from deterioration. over time through genetic replication, these telomeres are worn down, and eventually our genetic material also begins to deteriorate. this is what causes ageing deterioration, as cells eventually become unable to continue replicating, or create errors.   there are enzymes that allow for the rebuilding of telomeres, and therefore no more aging. unfortunately the degradation of telomeres also works to naturally prevent mutations in our chromosomes. by rebuilding these telomeres, we instead start to create mutations and in turn, cancer. so yeah, it becomes very tricky, and as such there's not much being said about it, as this is where we've hit a wall.  fun fact: naked molerats employ this and are basically immortal as a result.  disclaimer: this knowledge is coming from a course i took a few years ago, so please people who are specialised in this correct anything i have gotten wrong and further discuss. i am very interested to hear  the scientific explanation for this.",0,,

743241,"a lot of physically disabled people - who proudly identify with the word disabled - disagree with the classification of physical disability as an ""illness"" or ""medical issue"" as well, also held up by an analysis of the historical treatment of their communities.  for example, this excerpt from *capitalism and disability* by keith rosenthal and martha russell:  ""the primary oppression of disabled persons (i.e., of people who could work in a workplace that was accommodated to their needs) is their exclusion from exploitation as wage laborers. studies show that disabled persons experience lower labor-force participation rates, higher unemployment rates, and higher part-time employment rates than non-disabled persons.  [...]  historical materialism provides a theoretical base from which to explain these conditions and outcomes. under feudalism, economic exploitation was direct and political, made possible by the feudal concentration of land ownership. while a few owners reaped the surplus, many living on their estates worked for subsistence and disabled people were able to participate in this economy to varying degrees...with the advent of capitalism, people were no longer tied to the land, but they were forced to find work that would pay a wage‚Äîor starve; and as production became industrialized, people‚Äôs bodies [and minds] were increasingly valued for their ability to function like machines...as work became more rationalized, requiring precise mechanical movements of the body, repeated in quicker succession, impaired persons‚Äîthe deaf, blind, mentally impaired, and those with mobility difficulties‚Äîwere seen as‚Äîand, without job accommodations to meet their impairments, were‚Äîless ‚Äòfit‚Äô to do the tasks required of factory workers, and were increasingly excluded from paid employment.15 and so ‚Äúthe operation of the labour market in the nineteenth century effectively depressed handicapped people of all kinds to the bottom of the market.  [...]  *the ‚Äúmedicalization‚Äù of disablement and the tools of classification clearly played an important role in establishing divisions between the ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù and the ‚Äúable-bodied.‚Äù* disability became an important ‚Äúboundary‚Äù category whereby people were allocated to either a work-based or a needs-based system of distribution. [‚Ä¶] *the disability category was essential to the development of an exploitable workforce in early capitalism and remains indispensable as an instrument of the state in controlling the labor supply today. by focusing on curing so-called abnormalities and segregating those who could not be cured into the administrative category of ‚Äòdisabled,‚Äô medicine cooperated in shoving less exploitable workers out of the mainstream workforce.*  ‚Äòdisability‚Äô is a social creation which defines who is offered a job and who is not, and what it means varies with the level of economic activity.""",1,,0
133366,"yes, but ableism is bullshit, so nobody should care.  &gt; a practiced wheelchair user can indeed often move more quickly than a person relying on leg muscles alone. ... the problem, of course, is that many places and spaces do not facilitate such free use of a wheelchair.  we can build exoskeletons that turn into wheelchairs, providing the best of both worlds and turning disabled kids into transformers.   &gt;  the legs are immobile. the eyes do not see. the ears do not hear. these conditions are inherently value neutral.   bollocks. these are shortcomings in the standard abilities of the human body. redefining disability as contingent on societal contributions instead of how the body works is patronizing to the disabled. the sighted are inherently more capable than the blind, the hearing more capable than the deaf, the upright more capable than the wheelchair-bound. an able person can potentially read braille, use sign language, and spin around the room in a wheelchair *at the same time,* then walk away while talking on the phone and playing a video game. to say the physical defects that prevent or hinder any of that aren't disabling is an outright lie.   technology offers us the opportunity to raise the disabled above the necessity for special aid. a blind man with ocr software in his glasses can read printed signs at any distance. deaf children given cochlear implants are alerted to unseen dangers. a wheelchair-bound woman wearing mechanized legs can climb mountains that will never be altered to accommodate her.   the objections to this suit in particular are especially ridiculous for lack of a 'wheelchair culture.' having useless legs does not make you a minority. there are no special languages for amputees. paraplegics are demonstrably and objectively less capable than able-bodied individuals without the aid of prosthetics. exoskeletons and other robotics go beyond springy legs and rubber hands to allow the disabled effortless superhuman strength. it is factual, not discriminatory, to suggest that this is an improvement over a wheelchair or a hook.",1,,0

428999,"when does it stop? who decides what something seemingly normal and innocuous (yes, ""retard"" is a normal english term) becomes offensive to someone? there is a point beyond which this silliness has to stop.  i'll just leave this poignant observation by the late great george carlin here:  "" george carlin - euphemisms  i don't like words that hide the truth.  i don't words that conceal reality. i don't like euphemisms, or euphemistic language. and american english is loaded with euphemisms. cause americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality. americans have trouble facing the truth, so they invent the kind of a soft language to protest themselves from it, and it gets worse with every generation. for some reason, it just keeps getting worse. i'll give you an example of that. there's a condition in combat. most people know about it. it's when a fighting person's nervous system has been stressed to it's absolute peak and maximum. can't take anymore input. the nervous system has either (click) snapped or is about to snap. in the first world war, that condition was called shell shock . simple, honest, direct language. two syllables, shell shock . almost sounds like the guns themselves. that was seventy years ago. then a whole generation went by and the second world war came along and very same combat condition was called battle fatigue . four syllables now. takes a little longer to say. doesn't seem to hurt as much. fatigue is a nicer word than shock. shell shock! battle fatigue. then we had the war in korea, 1950. madison avenue was riding high by that time, and the very same combat condition was called operational exhaustion. hey, were up to eight syllables now! and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase. it's totally sterile now. operational exhaustion. sounds like something that might happen to your car. then of course, came the war in viet nam, which has only been over for about sixteen or seventeen years, and thanks to the lies and deceits surrounding that war, i guess it's no surprise that the very same condition was called post-traumatic stress disorder. still eight syllables, but we've added a hyphen! and the pain is completely buried under jargon. post-traumatic stress disorder. i'll bet you if we'd of still been calling it shell shock, some of those viet nam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time. i'll betcha. i'll betcha. but.  but, it didn't happen, and one of the reasons. one of the reasons is because we were using that soft language. that language that takes the life out of life. and it is a function of time. it does keep getting worse. i'll give you another example. sometime during my life. sometime during my life, toilet paper became bathroom tissue. i wasn't notified of this. no one asked me if i agreed with it. it just happened. toilet paper became bathroom tissue. sneakers became running shoes. false teeth became dental appliances. medicine became medication. information became directory assistance. the dump became the landfill. car crashes became automobile accidents. partly cloudy bacame partly sunny. motels became motor lodges. house trailers became mobile homes. used cars became previously owned transportation. room service became guest-room dining. and constipation became occasional irregularity. when i was a little kid, if i got sick they wanted me to go to the hospital and see a doctor. now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization...or a wellness center to consult a healthcare delivery professional. poor people used to live in slums. now the economically disadvantaged occupy substandard housing in the inner cities. and they're broke! they're broke! they don't have a negative cash-flow position. they're fucking broke! cause a lot of them were fired. you know, fired. management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area, so many people are no longer viable members of the workforce. smug, greedy, well-fed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins.  it's as simple as that. the cia doesn't kill anybody anymore, they neutralize people...or they depopulate the area. the government doesn't lie, it engages in disinformation. the pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation in something they call sunshine units. israeli murderers are called commandos. arab commandos are called terrorists. contra killers are called freedom fighters. well, if crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire, what do freedom fighters fight? they never mention that part of it to us, do they? never mention that part of it. and...and some of this stuff is just silly, we all know that, like on the airlines, they say want to pre- board.  well, what the hell is pre-board, what does that mean? to get on before you get on? they say they're going to pre-board those passengers in need of special assistance. cripples! simple honest direct language. there is no shame attached to the word cripple that i can find in any dictionary. no shame attached to it, in fact it's a word used in bible translations. jesus healed the cripples. doesn't take seven words to describe that condition. but we don't have any cripples in this country anymore. we have the physically challenged . is that a grotesque enough evasion for you? how about differently abled . i've heard them called that. differently abled! you can't even call these people handicapped anymore. they'll say, ""were not handicapped. were handicapable!"" these poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition, somehow you'll change the condition. well, hey cousin, ppsssspptttttt. doesn't happen. doesn't happen. we have no more deaf people in this country, hearing impaired.  no ones blind anymore, partially sighted or visually impaired. we have no more stupid people. everyone has a learning disorder...or he's minimally exceptional. how would you like to be told that about your child?

713123,"tl;dr is that basically, ableism has been used to justify racism and sexism and other things. it was used to justify not giving women the vote, it was used to justify slavery. ableism formed the basis for immigration controls which then were used to prevent specific nationalities and religions from entering the us.  the article is already abridged from the original article and is quite short. i can paste it in full here if screen readers are an issue:  ""since the political revolutions of the eighteenth century, social and political thinkers have challenged ostensibly rational justifications for inequalities based on gender, race, and ethnicity. disability has been largely absent from that effort, despite its prominence in debates over equality. not only has disability justified the inequality of disabled people but of other groups as well. in the three great citizenship debates of the 19th century and early 20th centuries: women‚Äôs suffrage, african american freedom, and immigration restriction, disability played a substantive role. opponents of equality for women cited their supposed physical, intellectual, and psychological disabilities: physical frailty, irrationality, and emotional instability. supporters of racial inequality and immigration restriction invoked the supposed disabilities of particular races and ethnic groups. thus, while disabled people are one of the minority groups historically assigned inferior status, disability has functioned for all such groups as a justification of that status.  a common argument for slavery was that the impaired intelligence of african americans made them incapable of equality with other americans. medical authorities explained that it is the ‚Äúa deficiency of cerebral matter in the cranium, and an excess of nervous matter distributed to the organs of sensation and assimilation, [caused] that debasement of mind, which has rendered the people of africa unable to take care of themselves.‚Äù[1] education was ‚Äúat the expense of the body, shortening the existence,‚Äù resulting in bodies ‚Äúdwarfed or destroyed‚Äù by unnatural exertion.[2] african americans would be even further disabled by freedom. dr. samuel cartwright, in 1851, claimed that a ‚Äúdisease of the mind‚Äù that caused slaves to run away, which he termed ‚Äúdrapetomania,‚Äù struck slaves whose masters had ‚Äúmade themselves too familiar with them, treating them as equals.‚Äù ‚Äúdysaesthesia aethiopis,‚Äù whose symptoms included a desire to avoid work and cause mischief, was nearly universal among free blacks and a ‚Äúcommon occurrence on badly-governed plantations.‚Äù[3] medical journals reported that deafness and blindness were far more common among free blacks than slaves. senator john c. calhoun of south carolina alleged that the ‚Äúnumber of deaf and dumb, blind, idiots, and insane, of the negroes in the states that have changed the ancient relation between the races‚Äù was seven times higher than in the slave states.[4] in 1896, the north carolina medical journal still thought it worthwhile to inquire into ‚Äúthe effect of freedom upon the mental and physical health of the negroes of the south.‚Äù it found ‚Äúmore congenital defects,‚Äù a dramatic increase in mental illness and tuberculosis, and overall a ‚Äúharvest of mental and physical degeneration.‚Äù[5]  during the debate over women‚Äôs suffrage, suffrage opponents pointed to women‚Äôs physical, intellectual, and psychological defects. paralleling slavery arguments, they claimed both that women‚Äô disabilities made them incapable of equality and that its burden would result in even greater disability. their ‚Äúgreat temperamental disabilities,‚Äù the fact that ‚Äúwoman lacks endurance in things mental,‚Äù that ‚Äúshe lacks nervous stability,‚Äù meant that political participation would lead to ‚Äúnervous prostration‚Äù and ‚Äúhysteria.‚Äù a prominent neurophysiologist, charles l. dana, estimated that enfranchising women would increase insanity among them, and ‚Äúthrow into the electorate a mass of voters of delicate nervous stability . . . which might do injury to itself.‚Äù edward clarke, in sex in education; or, a fair chance for girls, maintained that, already, overuse of the brain was responsible for ‚Äúnumberless pale, weak, neuralgic, dyspeptic, hysterical, menorraghic, dysmenorrhoeic girls and women.‚Äù special education designed for frail constitutions would ensure ‚Äúa future secure from neuralgia, uterine disease, hysteria, and other derangements of the nervous system.‚Äù a presenter at the medical society of new york in 1891 cautioned that inappropriate education incapacitated women for motherhood: ‚Äúher reproductive organs are dwarfed, deformed, weakened, and diseased.‚Äù popular science monthly maintained that educated women were ‚Äúsick and suffering before marriage and are physically disabled from performing physiological functions in a normal manner.‚Äù[6]  disability figured not only in arguments against equality but also for equality. rather than challenging the notion that disability justified inequality, like anti-slavery writers before them, suffragists denied that women had disabilities and therefore deserved citizenship rights. this argument was already in evidence in 1848 at the seneca falls woman‚Äôs rights convention, where delegates resolved that ‚Äúthe equality of human rights results necessarily from the fact of the identity of the race in capabilities and responsibilities,‚Äù and further that ‚Äúbeing invested by the creator with the same capabilities ‚Ä¶ it is demonstrably the right and duty of woman‚Äù to participate in political life. frederick douglass proclaimed that ‚Äúthe true basis of rights was the capacity of individuals.‚Äù[7] suffragists turned the rhetorical power of the disability argument to their own uses in posters depicting women surrounded by slope-browed, wild-eyed men, identified implicitly or explicitly as ‚Äúidiots‚Äù and ‚Äúlunatics,‚Äù with captions such as ‚Äúwomen and her political peers,‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs time i got out of this place. where shall i find the key?‚Äù they asked why women should be classed with ‚Äúidiots, lunatics, persons under guardianship and felons,‚Äù and charged that women were ‚Äúthrust outside the pale of political consideration with minors, paupers, lunatics, traitors, [and] idiots.‚Äù[8]  american immigration policy makers have long sought to exclude disabled people. the immigration act of 1882 prohibited entry to any ‚Äúlunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge.‚Äù ‚Äúlunatics‚Äù and ‚Äúidiots‚Äù were automatically excluded, while the ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù provision targeted disabled people more generally. the bar for admission was steadily raised over the next four decades. the act of 1891 replaced the phrase ‚Äúunable to take care of himself or herself,‚Äù with ‚Äúlikely to become a public charge.‚Äù the 1907 law excluded anyone with a ‚Äúmental or physical defect being of a nature which may affect the ability of such alien to earn a living,‚Äù and regulations for inspectors directed them to exclude persons with ‚Äúany mental abnormality whatever.‚Äù the 1917 regulations listed possible reasons for exclusion, among them arthritis, asthma, bunions, deafness, deformities, flat feet, heart disease, hernia, hysteria, poor eyesight, poor physical development, spinal curvature, vascular disease of the heart, and varicose veins.[9]  in short, the exclusion of disabled people was central to immigration policy. by 1896, the atlantic monthly could confidently claim that the necessity of ‚Äústraining out‚Äù immigrants who were ‚Äúdeaf, dumb, blind, idiotic, insane, pauper, or criminal‚Äù was ‚Äúnow conceded by men of all shades of opinion.‚Äù and by 1907, the commissioner general of immigration could assert without fear of contradiction that ‚Äúthe exclusion from this country of the morally, mentally, and physically deficient is the principal object to be accomplished by the immigration laws.‚Äù[10]  once such laws were firmly established, attention turned to undesirable ethnic groups, and for this task the concept of disability was a powerful tool. in 1924, a quota system was instituted that severely limited the numbers of immigrants from southern and eastern europe. a rhetoric of ‚Äúdefective races,‚Äù rooted in claims that certain nationalities were prone to congenital defects, was an essential element in configuring the image of the ‚Äúinferior immigrant.‚Äù references to ‚Äúthe slow-witted slav,‚Äù the ‚Äúneurotic condition of our jewish immigrants,‚Äù and the ‚Äúdegenerate and psychopathic types, which are so conspicuous and numerous among the immigrants‚Äù was pervasive in the debate. as a sociologist noted, ‚Äúthe physiognomy of certain groups unmistakably proclaims inferiority of type.‚Äù among immigrants that he observed at ellis island, ‚Äúin every face there was something wrong.‚Äù moreover, italians were ‚Äúdwarfish,‚Äù portuguese, greeks, and syrians were ‚Äúundersized,‚Äù and jews were ‚Äúvery poor in physique . . . the polar opposite of our pioneer breed.‚Äù[11] the issues of ethnicity and disability were so intertwined in the immigration debate as to be inseparable.  the attribution of disease or disability to oppressed groups has a long history. yet, while many have pointed out the injustice of such attributions, few have asked why they are such powerful tools for inequality and what this tells us about historical attitudes toward disability. the reflexive denial of disability among those seeking equality suggests tacit acknowledgement across the political spectrum that when disability is present, inequality is indeed justified. this may go a long way toward explaining why discrimination against disabled people has been so persistent and the struggle for disability rights so difficult.""",1,,0

408560,"tristan, dan, julie and anna were making history. they were to be the first people with a significant disability sent into space.  *disabled...* dan thought. *i always hated that term.*  the group often lamented the fact that merely speaking the word ""disabled"" predisposed others to certain presumptions about them. they must be paralyzed, wheelchair bound, mentally impaired, or missing certain limbs.  instead, the four pioneers merely suffered from a lack of hearing. they were all deaf. tristan and anna had always been deaf, having never known anything but a silent existence. dan and julie, on the other hand, didn't lose their hearing until several years after birth, around ten years old. they at least got to experience all the sounds life had to offer before one thing or another took it from them.   *not sure which is worse, really,* tristan often thought. *those fortunate enough to have their hearing are incapable of understanding what a gift it is. dan and julie are among the few who have the perspective to realize what a terrible thing living a life in complete and total silence can be when the world used to be so full of sound.*  the group had a sort of inside joke with each other; that in space, even the healthiest, most able-bodied and sensory-gifted individual might as well be deaf. to an extent, anyway. they say in space, no one can you scream.  *fortunate for us, then, that we can't hear you scream anyway,* anna would joke.   the humor was a little dark, but it was sufficient to ease their nerves. they were all well-educated individuals; top of the class at various ivy league institutions. they all knew sign language and were capable of reading lips. dan and julie still spoke with their voices from time to time, despite being unable to hear themselves.  the group was assigned to rendezvous with the iss, still under construction and expansion decades after its inception. it had grown rather enormous over all those years, now roughly the size of three adjoining football stadiums. space travel had become a bit more frequent in the last ten years, with private companies offering tourist trips to space for particularly wealthy customers. the iss was still off limits though, restricted merely to observation for those private space tourists.   truth be told, the group's assignment wasn't any different from what would be assigned to a ""regular"" group of astronauts. rather, the decision to send four hearing-impaired individuals was merely a statement by nasa that qualifications for those who would be sent to space for important tasks could be expanded so long as more necessary requirements in the realm of academics and various fields were met.   it wasn't long before the impressive sight of the iss came into view. the group all crowded around a single window to gaze in awe at the scale of earth's greatest collective effort. it was a sight to behold.   tristan got dan's attention and signed to him, ""i bet the crew we're relieving is going to be awfully disappointed when they're told they have to leave.""  ""hey now, in only a couple of months, we're going to be that dejected crew,"" dan fired back with a smile.   just then, several lights on the ship's comm systems began flashing, demanding the attention of its deaf passengers. all four crew members glided over to the comms panel to answer a call from nasa hq back at home.  ""bad news,"" houston began, a sign language interpreter rapidly signing as he spoke. ""you guys are going to have to sit tight for a while. docking permission with the iss has been temporarily suspended pending investigation of a mechanical anomaly on board.""  ""come on, houston,"" anna signed at the camera. ""now you're just teasing us,"" she finished with a smile.  mission control chuckled in response before saying, ""hey, it's probably nothing, but if it is something, you'll be thanking us for being a little extra cautious. sit tight. we're looking at 24 hours minimum before docking permission can be granted.""  the group rolled their eyes as the call disconnected. they were on a rather strict schedule. they had to stick to a usual 24 hour day-night cycle with a certain number of hours of sleep each ""night,"" along with a certain number of hours of exercise each week they were in space. knowing it would now be 24 hours before they could dock with the iss and settle into their own quarters, they began making the most of their comparatively meager shuttle rooms.   dan set the shuttle in a holding pattern to match with the orbit of the iss around the earth. as soon as they got permission to dock, they would be able to do so quickly. dan volunteered to stay up at the cockpit while the other three crew members would fruitlessly try to get some sleep; a tall order during a first trip to space.  *sleep?* dan thought. *how can they even think about trying to sleep?*  for hours, dan stared into the black void of space, occasionally glancing over at the nearby iss, peacefully floating around the earth. dan mused that whatever may have gone wrong on board the iss must not have been very serious, as the various lights were still illuminating several parts of its imposing structure against the nigh-invisible dark background.   -------------------------------------------  dan awoke with a jolt. he whipped his head around the cockpit, scrambling his mind while checking the onboard systems. how did he fall asleep? how? he wasn't even remotely tired and was actually enjoying the sights of pitch black space. trying to suppress mounting panic, he checked the comms panel and was relieved to see he had not missed any communications from houston.   *can't have been out for very long, at least,* dan thought as he relaxed ever so slightly. he glanced again at the iss, still floating so peacefully alongside them. dan couldn't help but notice that a few of the lights from the ship had gone out, and a few were flickering.  *must be bed time for some of those folks,* dan figured. the flashing lights didn't give him any pause. some features and inner-workings of the iss would be a total mystery to him and the others until they boarded.   dan unbuckled himself from his seat and glided over to the other side of the ship to take a look at earth. as he did so, he froze in place.  whether his mind was too jostled to process it when he woke up or whether it had just begun, dan wasn't sure. suddenly, dan realized he was hearing...something. dan could only think of it as a *buzz* of some sort; static, or white noise. but it seemed to be growing louder. dan wasn't sure what to think. *space madness already?* dan thought to himself in an effort to relieve tension.  as he made his way down one of the short shafts of the shuttle, the faintest, higher pitched buzz joined in. separate but apparently similar to the first buzz. it grew ever so slightly louder as he drew closer to the crew's quarters, peaking in volume when he was right outside the door to their bunks.   just then, in a split second, both buzzes became overwhelmingly loud. dan, who had not been able to hear anything since he was a child, was covering his ears with his hands, attempting to block out the piercing sound, desperate for a return to his silent existence.   dan slid open the door to the crew's quarters and was greeted by a terrifying sight. tristan and julie were floating lazily, motionless, eyes wide open, mouths agape. anna was floating, knees up to her chest, hands covering her ears. dan realized the high pitched *buzzing* he seemed to hear was in fact anna's piercing shrieks.   it was too much for dan's mind to process. he hadn't the slightest idea what was going on. he wasn't even sure if anna had noticed him. instead of getting her attention, dan guided himself back to the cockpit to get in touch with houston.   as dan fought to drown out the piercing shrieks and buzzes from his mind, he fidgeted with the comms panel, struggling to put together a coherent thought.   and then, without warning, it stopped. both the high-pitch shriek that must've been anna's screams and the low-pitched *buzzing* ceased entirely. dan paused before putting through a call to houston, taking a moment to try to process what was happening. after a moment, he hit the call button. nothing went through. convincing himself not to panic -- not yet -- he unbuckled himself again to go check on anna and the others. as he did so, he took another glance at the iss.   it was gone.  dan's eyes grew wide as he hurriedly guided himself back to the crew's quarters. he had left the door open, and as he rounded a short corner, he was greeted by anna's lifeless body floating lazily into the shaft, individual droplets of blood dripping from her eyes, mouth, nose and ears.  it was then that the low-pitched *buzzing* returned, only this time, in a pattern. it was all dan could hear; not the ship's systems nor the sound of the comms panel alerting him to an urgent call from houston. the pattern was slow. a long buzz, then a pause, then a longer buzz. short buzz, pause, long, short, long, long. dan couldn't help but think it was the closest thing to spoken language he had heard in decades.  he made his way back towards the cockpit. upon arrival, he stared out against into the dark void of space, where the iss had just been peacefully floating hours earlier. he realized that the very spot where the iss had been seemed to be even darker than the void around it. the light from earth seemed to cease at that spot, yet continued to venture out into the abyss everywhere else.   as dan processed all of this, the ship experienced a sudden, violent jolt towards the abyss. dan looked to his right to gaze upon the earth.  it was gone.",1,,2

(which he even admits to). i'm sorry, jesse, but all of those lines are old; they've been old for the past four years. this feels copy-and-pasted as always.  you have him pretending to be nostradamus with his predictions per tradition; let's be honest, they are all educated guesses at best. some are worded in a way that could make any event seem like it was correct. it's just vague wording that the mind fills in. as an example, i can make the prediction right now that ""covid will still be a thing at the end of 2023!"" even if somehow the case numbers dropped substantially, i could always say that it is ""still here in some form or another!""  the excuses he uses for the lack of content get old as well. how many times have we heard it? most of what he said you could condense into two minutes, but instead you get long rambles about his issues. the whining is getting very petty at this point. every single yearly review has consisted of this formula: ""whine about the current state. promise that things will be better going forward. wait until the end of the year. repeat.""  also, it's **not** going to be better. he's pretty much confirmed that he's not going to be doing much with the mcjuggernuggets content front this year. a potential mve has been scrapped. no ideas of any other projects. nothing more than vague promises of ""cinematic content and real life vlogs."" he's not even committing to an upload number, which give him the excuse to post one or two videos this year. don't worry, though, he said **he'll still be pumping that finance content for his five fans over there! yeet!**  you also have a pasted cheesy motivational speech at the end that really puts icing on the garbage-cake. **what a great year-in-review! /s**",0,,

786290,"i so hear you, i'm edging up to 30 soon and i'm trying to make a decision by about 32 as after 35 things get harder and more complicated. first, i love kids...as long as they are other people's - but i've often thought about how awesome being pregnant would be. i like the idea of pregnancy of growing something inside your body, of planning to meet that little person one day, of nesting, of being able to shape a human being to make a difference in the world. but then i think about what it is that i see for my life. i honestly know in my heart that if my partner and i never had a child and went through life without having that experience, we wouldn't feel like we missed all that much. we'd be the doting uncle and aunt to my family's children - hell i'm already bonded to his sister's kids. but that being said, if we did end up having a child, it would be the cutest smartest most wonderful kid who would no doubt bring us much joy at the cost of some of our freedom and some of our own personal goals.  i certainly don't want kids now and even though people say that will change as i get older, every year it's the same thing for me ""maybe in 7 years or so"". so i think that i will end up not having kids. for one, i have endometriosis, so i'm on constant bc and would have to deliberately stop for about a year in order to conceive at this point. plus i'm not entirely sure that i can, if endometriosis spreads to my ovaries, it could make me infertile. and while i don't like having options limited, that doesn't really upset me. everyone has their own limits for what feels right to them. for me, i could never do more than harvest some eggs, plant one or two and see if they take. but even then, the physical pain and emotional hell of doing that seems like too high of a price to pay. (i have a history of eating disorders, severe depression, and anxiety that are majorly aggravated by fluctuations of my hormones...serious crazy - not safe) now since i like the idea of being pregnant but not the idea of a kid, people often suggest surrogacy. again, not something i'm willing to do on many levels. one, you bond with a growing child and then give it up? no way, i couldn't do that. plus, adoption is so needed, and sometimes, it's just best to accept the limitations of what a body is capable of. although i know for myself, that i couldn't do that, bless people who can it's so needed. but i know in my heart that child would always be someone else's kid in my mind. and they deserve more than that. so i'm not really into doing a whole lot to get a kid.   family is a consideration, being the first-born and only girl makes me the default ""baby-maker"" for my family. so i completely understand the pressure of the ""next-generation"" too. also, my family is crazy - alcoholism, addictions galore, bi-polar, major depression, anxiety, eating disorders, suicide attempts, then also cancer, obesity, high blood pressure, heart and lung diseases, blindness, diabetes, pretty much every box on the health history form can be filled out by one or more of my relatives. but just remember that you can break the cycle (my brothers and i are the first generation to beat the illnesses in my family). nothing is set in stone, and genetic predispositions are just that, you can fight them to a certain extent. so don't let the fear and worry make you not have a child you might want.  basically, i took a look at where i want to be: i want to have a small nicely furnished vintage condo in the city, i want to be able to travel with my partner and focus on us building careers in our fields that will impact the world a little bit. i want to have the time to volunteer, to have the money to eat organic and local all the time, to be able to donate funds to worthy causes, and to not worry about debt ever again, to live happily within our means. i just don't see a child in this vision of the future.   but every now and again, i'd love to have my partners child. but we see that differently too. we see being able to telecommute a few days a week each, so one of us is always home with our child. we see us both being active parents who are able to leave work to go to important events like parent teacher conferences and school plays without retribution in our careers. we believe strongly that the current work situation needs to change before we can have a family centered life instead of our children falling behind our need to earn a living. if more options were available for working parents now, the idea of having children would be more appealing to me. but i know that having a child would mean one or both of us sacrificing things that we want. and we don't want to do that. that's not a real choice.",1,,-1
171502,"dude...i know exactly what you're saying but it's pretty simple what i'm saying.   the dog wasn't unhealthy, it was just born deformed, it was a healthy animal that was not able to function.    i could go into so much detail with you about this as you're clearly an intelligent person but it does seem rather like you're splitting hairs on this rather a lot.    disease - that's a malfunction in your body, something that develops, something that causes genuine ill health (ie cancer)  virus - this is an invader, something that invades your body and causes ill health.  in most cases it's short term but then there are things like aids which basically destroys your protection by attacking it.  you're ill because your immune system fights it off, hence you go home with the flu and feel shit for 3 weeks.    then there are physical abnormalities such as being born a siamese twin for example - you could say that this is unhealthy - but generally the actual body itself has no issues, it's just the physics that is suffering and causing problems elsewhere.  yes you could class this as ill health but not really...for if everything is working ok and the cells are all healthy you can't really say that can you?? or maybe you can.   if you lose a leg, you may have to recover but it does not take away from your general health - its' only the strain on the body as healing occurs that affects your health.    in this pups case, it literally couldn't live a normal life, as in, it was simply non functioning - unable to function due to the shape it was born in.  it does not mean that the animal did not have a very strong appetite, a very good immune system and a good set of bones, simply that they were the wrong shape and that it would have died in the wild or had to be put down.....  there are lots of areas you could pull into this debate such as are the brain damaged ill of health?? i don't think so...disability and ill health are different, perhaps the line is very fine but it does exist and there is a significant difference.  i would say that ill health occurs when the bodies immune system comes under attack and puts a strain on its functions.  i'm trying to think of a good metaphor but i can't really......i guess the closest one would be that just because a car didn't have a door doesn't mean it couldn't run properley....i dunno something of that ilk.  i agree that one factor can affect the other but i do stand by the fact that a healthy being can be born but still be unable to survive if they are disabled in some way.",0,,

484175,"it was hard for me to accept myself as disabled. for a long time i was disabled up until high school with a learning disability and had an iep for so many years. ieps are generally only for kids that are classified as developmentally disabled to some extent.   then i was diagnosed with a few mental health conditions which was my biggest battle on whether i was still disabled or not as the disabled community love to gatekeep whether mental disorders are really disabling.   then i developed neuropathy in my feet about 2 years ago. i also developed a drop foot which leaves me at risk for falls. my foot and knee development causes me to have bad balance. the dropped foot causes my left ankle to be weak which results in my ankle giving out. even on the smallest of uneven surfaces. i‚Äôve ripped more clothes falling and bled more times then i can count! i should invest in a first aid kit for my car.   when i went to see my physiotherapist to get my issues fixed she classified as as physically disabled and approved me for a handicap placard (and of course those are only for people with a very specific physical disability depending on your region).   for example my disability prevents or severely limits me in the following areas in life:   - i can‚Äôt stand for more then 1 minute and 30 seconds without feeling extreme pay in my feet.   - i can‚Äôt stand in a lineup without extreme pain   - i sometimes go through flares (my longest was 3 months) where my feet just chronically hurt and most of my day is spent icing or heating my feet.   - my balance is very bad. just walking i can fall into cars, people, walls, you name it. almost fell on a few clients at work!   - when i stand (especially at night) my balance becomes extra bad. i was standing at the end of the porch stairs at work and just fell backwards randomly almost down the stairs and my clients caught me. i learned my lesson that day.   - my ankle has given out many times sending ne flying. two scariest times was i almost flew into a 90 year old women and i flew in front of a truck in a parking lot. these falls leave me bloody with bruised knees or hands and ripped up pants (i legit wanted to stop wearing nice clothes at some point).   - i use a cane to help with my balance. it helps so much to have that anchor on the left side. my leg is so weak i have muscle wasting in my left leg.   - i use a rollator and days where i am going through a flare or i just need to sit because of the pain.   - my balance was so bad i had a hard time getting measured and taped by the podiatrist so she heavily encouraged me to get an mri on mg brain lol. that mri came back clean lol. it just kinda shows that others were starting to see my physical limitations.    all in all, i am still going through testing to see what may be causing the neuropathy and other physical disabilities, but what really validated was getting approved for an accessible permit for a permanent disability. so i don‚Äôt have to be reassessed by a doctor for renewal i just apply within the service ontario. permanent placards are generally hard to get. my physiotherapist and a second physiotherapist i saw both said my issues likely stemmed from being developmentally delayed and will likely be permanent in most aspects.   once i do more testing maybe there will be more options. i am young, fit, and have a lot of energy.   my provinces definition (ontario canada) of disability is:   ‚Äúdefining disability is a complex, evolving matter. the term ‚Äúdisability‚Äù covers a broad range and degree of conditions. a disability may have been present at birth, caused by an accident, or developed over time. section 10 of the code defines ‚Äúdisability‚Äù as:  any degree of physical disability, infirmity, malformation or disfigurement that is caused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, a brain injury, any degree of paralysis, amputation, lack of physical co-ordination, blindness or visual impediment, deafness or hearing impediment, muteness or speech impediment, or physical reliance on a guide dog or other animal or on a wheelchair or other remedial appliance or device,  a condition of mental impairment or a   developmental disability,  a learning disability, or a dysfunction in one or more of the processes involved in understanding or using symbols or spoken language,  a mental disorder, or  an injury or disability for which benefits were claimed or received under the insurance plan established under the workplace safety and insurance act, 1997.‚Äù  https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-ableism-and-discrimination-based-disability/2-what-disability",1,,0
612620,"**physical disability**  so the most common forms of disability after the breaking are incurred via injury. in some places, it's legitimately difficult to find somebody who hasn't at least lost a finger to an accident or monster attack.  in most of these cases, disability is handled with an eye towards accommodation, but with the problem that nearly *all* new construction in the world is made from recycled materials. the prairie view apartment empire's capital, prairie view apartments, is arguably the most successful at this, having made their primary complex nearly completely handicap-accessible (well, ramp-wise at least. automatic doors are a work in progress, as the wiring in prairie view causes temporary madness in those who behold it).  wheelchairs are feasible, but less popular in less-developed areas of the world. in the screaming plains of eternal blood, antigua scotia, and the basal valley, it's often more convenient to ride another creature, like a chariot beetle, a dude with a piggyback fetish, or a dire bear. the comparative rarity of humans in the world means that one person in such a situation often has many mounts, akin to how mongolian horse-warriors would have multiple horses.  **social views towards disability**  mercifully, ableism is less common after the breaking, partially due to the fact that most of the world's most vitriolic assholes got lumped together in a single location, and partially due to the fact that, again, disability is far more common. prairie view emperor todd lipinsky is missing his left leg below the knee. high priestess of walla walla emma perez has a form of blindness that mostly prevents her from reading or seeing color. caravan fist k.a.r.l. of the shining seas caravan #616, ""peregrine iron"" shares a similar disability. havel johnson of the chthonic riviera might not be physically disabled, but it's generally agreed that the man is probably neurodivergent.  **world-specific mental disabilities and disorders: mutant mindset**  on the topic of neurodivergence, a relatively common form of ""special needs"" in the post-breaking world is just being straight-up mutated by eldritch radiation.  mutants are fairly common in the world, and are generally agreed to be better-suited for post-apocalyptic life due to their physical prowess and natural defenses. however, they're extremely prone to wanderlust, distractability, and fixation on specific topics (particularly subgenres of music). they're basically guaranteed to not be able to hold down a steady job, aside from serving as caravaneers. due to their tendency towards executive dysfunction and often-terrifying appearance, most mutants handle their neurodivergence by clinging together in small groups, typically united by their shared interests. oftentimes they start a band. peregrine iron is a traditional heavy metal band fronted by skin glue and k.a.r.l. the coral reapers are a jimmy buffet tribute band fronted by vocalist margarita mary and steel drum virtuoso, island joe the exsanguinator.  alleyfolk share something similar, although they tend to be less ""distractable"" and more ""generally cantankerous"". legends tell of a fallen settlement, called ""the town of fuck you josh,"" that serve as a warning to alleyfolk who try to settle in too close of proximity to one another. this is, of course, a bit of an unfair stereotype. ol' hooktoe is an alleyman and a real bro. mercifully, alleyfolk are a clever, hard-bitten lot who are good at improvisation, and can survive on their own rather well.  **world-specific mental disabilities: lost mind**  a rare, but increasingly-common disorder in the post-breaking area is ""lost mind."" it's less of a unified disorder and more of a response to eldritch trauma. people who survive lost places, pocket dimensions which eventually return to the main world, typically develop some kind of mental hangup that ranges from ""quirky"" to ""outright debilitating."" sam putnam, host of the program studio community worldwide radio, has crippling agoraphobia that prevents him from leaving his home. krysta golden, his co-host and general menace, is perpetually-cheerful, extroverted, slightly amoral and highly aggressive. emma perez is convinced that she alone can save the world. this often comes with a handful of supernatural abilities (sam putnam's psychic shout, krysta golden's superhuman strength, emma perez's limited clairvoyance, the ability of lost place survivors to actually be heard over wireless communication), but it still is difficult for these people to fully integrate into mainstream society. they either become liminal figures (like the reclusive putnam) who depend on the unique qualities of lost place survivors for a living, or quasi-legendary heroes (like golden and perez) who nonetheless would be incapable of surviving without their power.  **poorly-understood or ""invisible"" disabilities: common treatments**  other disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, chronic fatigue disorder, etc, are treated on a case-by-case basis. people with severe disorders often have to travel to the med center citadel, one of the few remaining places in the world with a massive stockpile of pharmaceuticals. unfortunately, the citadel is a quasi-military dictatorship that requires people to pay for medication with dangerous labor, so it's not perfect.  some people with chronic illness decide to undergo the mutation process, accepting that their bodies will be unrecognizable and their minds will be warped. others will take limited mutation treatments, which won't eliminate all the symptoms of their disorder, but *will* have lesser side effects. given that mutation treatments mostly consist of distilled water tainted by eldritch radiation, the barrier to this treatment is low. however, said treatment is often risky, as poorly-directed mutations can often leave people in a worse condition than they were to begin with.  **people who fall through the cracks**  others still will remain, tragically, untreated. while chronic disability is extraordinarily rare among alleyfolk, those who *do* develop such issues wind up suffering with this the most. the common aversion towards social interaction in the people of the free alleys means that all too often, people who need treatment lack resources and any kind of support network. a recent initiative by the deeps self-preservation association, spearheaded by alleymen willy henderson, erik ""taters"" tate and non-alley-woman quelaag van der waal, has taken a look into possible means of addressing this issue, but progress is slow going when you're dealing with a network of people who view most of the world with annoyance.",1,,-1

235769,"oh, lennon absolutely cheated on all his wives.   i addressed the disabled mocking above - it was a reaction to the constant stream of disabled folks (mainly children) who were pushed on the beatles to ""cure"" them (the disabled folks). in response to parents crying and begging them that if they would only see their children the children would be okay, all the twentysomething guys in the beatles admitted to using laughter as an outlet. from the beatles anthology:  &gt;john: wherever we went on tour, there were always a few seats laid aside for cripples and people in wheelchairs. because we were famous, we were supposed to have people, epileptics and whatever, in our dressing room all the time. we were supposed to be good for them.  &gt;you want to be alone and you don't know what to say, and they're usually saying, 'i've got your record,' or they can't speak and just want to touch you. and it's always the mother or nurse pushing them on you. they would push these people at you like you were christ, as if there were some aura about you that would rub off on them.  &gt;it got to be like that, and we were very callous about it. it was just dreadful. when we would open up, every night, instead of seeing kids there, we would see a row full of cripples along the front. when we'd be running through, people would be lying around. it seemed that we were just surrounded by cripples and blind people all the time, and when we would go through corridors they would all be touching us. it was horrifying.  &gt;in the states, they were bringing hundreds of them backstage, and it was fantastic. i can't stand looking at them. i have to turn away. i have to laugh, or i'd just collapse from hate. they'd line them up, and i got the impression the beatles were being treated as bloody faith healers. it was sickening. it was sort of the 'in' joke that we were supposed to cure them. it was the kind of thing that we would say. i mean, we felt sorry for them - anybody would - but it was awful. there's kind of embarrassment when you're surrounded by blind, deaf and crippled people - and there is only so much we could say with the pressure on to perform.  &gt;paul: i think that, particularly in the old days, the spirit of the beatles seemed to suggest something very hopeful and youthful. so, often, someone would ask us to say 'hello' to handicapped kids; to give them some kind of hope, maybe. but it was difficult for us, because part of our himour was a sick kind of humour. we were almost having to bless the people in wheelchairs; so there was this dual inclination going on for us.  &gt;john: we're not cruel. we've seen enough tragedy in merseyside. but when a mother shrieks, 'just touch my son and maybe he will walk again,' we want to run, cry, empty our pockets. we're going to remain normal if it kills us.  it's also worth noting that the reaction to john doing that at concerts was uproarious laughter from the audience and press - sadly it was not considered ""offensive"" at the time (50 years ago now).   brian epstein, the beatles manager, was gay and jewish. lennon often made jokes to him, but they were also extremely close friends. lennon had an acerbic sense of humor and all those close to him needed to give as good as they got.   lennon did express complete support for the gay rights movement as early as the early 70's and would even attend events at gay clubs. it is true that in 1963, john lennon got into a fistfight with a local deejay, bob wooler, at paul mccartney's birthday party. wooler had been taunting lennon all night about being a ""faggot"" for having gone on a vacation with brian epstein. i don't have any illusions that lennon was standing up for epstein, rather he punched wooler because of a twisted sense to ""prove"" his masculinity. (note that there are rumors lennon experimented sexually with men, notably epstein). however, in the context of 1963 liverpool, if someone is drunkenly taunting you for being a ""faggot"" and you are also a drunk young man, it's likely to end in fisticuffs. that's just the way it was in that environment.",1,,-1

343557,"the problem isn't with how the word has fallen into disuse, be it moron, idiot, dumb, stupid, or lame. the problem is with mocking the disabled and turning a disability into an insult.   as long as it's ok to compare someone to a mentally handicapped individual as a form of insult, it doesn't matter how many times we take a step back from a word and a draw a new line. society would just cross it again and *boom* they have a new insult! an insult which eventually makes it into the vernacular and becomes disassociated with the original meaning.  idiot means a person with a certain iq range? i don't think many people think of that when they use it. dumb means a mute? i don't think anyone makes that connection anymore eaither. but we all associate these words with a quality of dim-wittedness, slowness, low iq, etc. unfortunately, those qualities are still visible among the mentally handicapped. we may clarify with the likes of ""he's not *stupid*, he's a retard -- something's wrong with him!"" *but*, such clarifications means we can take what he is -- retard -- and apply it as an insult because it embodies the spirit of those other insults.  we need another means of insulting people without resorting to groups of people. maybe if we called everyone a shithead, that'll make things ok . . . i know, i know, we should technically not insult *anyone*, but there are *so many* shitheads out there, it's hard to be patient all the time :(.",1,,0
873242,"well done for thinking of this, i certainly didn't and i work with people with all kinds of disabilities for a job! i would therefore like to thank you for making the effort to accommodate other people also you have made me think i am going to completely re-organise how i will layout my rpg - goodbye walls of text!  if i was planning to include a section about advice i might think about different ""categories"" of disability:  for all people the main advice must be to make sure that they are asked what works for them. above anything else, it doesn't matter what disability someone has, they understand it better than you and will the first and best resource in how to help that person. don't be afraid of asking, it is the right thing to do.   you would also want to foster it being alright to ask questions and make mistakes - perhaps have a set time (during/after a break) to ask questions.  physical disabilities: are often going to be helped by having rest breaks built in order to stretch/move etc.  you might suggest that one person is in control of moving minis etc. [this may also help with people with autism.]   hearing impairments: i think you sound like you have some experience and others have suggested the use of visual materials. it might be a benefit to have a visual sheet of common phrases for giving orders: attack, move, cast etc. which someone could point at to make their meaning clear. this would also help people with mutism, or with non-verbal autism.  with this you could all learn some simple sign language like, ""kill"". or develop your own if a player is not fluent in sign language.  if someone is ""fully deaf"" and does not lip-read options become much more limited and unless you can use text software, a signer becomes one of the few options.   visual impairments: are going to benefit from clear and repeated information and a lack of cross/table talk. [also going to be very beneficial to people with autism or more severe dyslexia]. the other thing someone will benefit from is being passed things, or having a very clear set space in front of them. again many vi people can see things to an extent, and may be able to read text, for example, if it is in an appropriate font.   another important thing with vi is not to forget them, often vi people don't present as disabled at all. this means you can overlook the fact that actually they don't know where anything is on the table and have lost track of what you're saying.  autism/asperger's: the two types of autism (high-functioning/asperger's, and low-functioning - though some find those labels offensive) are about verbal language use. someone with ""more severe"" autism is more likely to struggle expressing themselves with verbal language, to the point of being completely mute. the strategies i suggested for a person with a hearing impairment might work here, they may have text to speech software, or use a form of sign/symbol language called makaton which is, again, very easy to use or replicate for your game's context. all people with autism [and this is true for adhd and some dyslexia (also dyspraxia and dyscalculia)] will struggle with sensory overload, either from the amount of info - spoken or visual. having information given clearly and to the point is the best approach, followed by a pause to allow processing to happen, without rephrasing or repeating the information. people with autism will often do ""stimming"" some repetitious pattern of behaviour, physical, spoken etc. - it's completely fine and is just part of regulating body, in the same way people yawn when nervous, or take a jumper off if too hot. in terms of the fabled autistic rigidity and following of rules it is at times over stated, autistic people are not incapable of chaos and disorder, but it helps when their expectations are met. therefore, you just make your game have open expectations - trying to avoid rigidity in the rules - and explain changes before they happen. in a comment you mentioned that someone might have a problem with removing a gm screen. there's no reason for that to be the case as long as you don't suddenly just decide to make that change. equally if in your rules you write ""you do not have to use a gm screen"" then, blamo, there's no expectation.   i think in terms of language that you use it is probably better to err on the side of caution in terms of being p.c. it is fine with someone you know and communicate to use the word ""deaf"" but maybe a product for general release might need to use a phrase like 'hearing impairment' (just as for ""blind"" you would say ""visual impairment""). the reasons i see for this are: 1 - as you show in your post deaf/blind are misleading as they imply ""cannot hear/see at all"" and that normally is not true. this leads to you having to use extra words to explain, ""deaf but not really deaf"". 2 - someone you know might be happy with the word deaf or make jokes about being in a wheelchair but people online reading your rpg might not be. i would always suggest it's better to use a politically (and generally) correct term so that people who might be offended by non-p.c. language won't be and people who aren't offended, still won't be offended.   hope it helps, i'll be interested to see what you decide to do in the end!",1,,2
860302,"this story leaves out something very important.  source:  **nkhr briefing report no.7: status of women‚Äôs rights in the context of socio-economic changes in the dprk**  https://uprdoc.ohchr.org/uprweb/downloadfile.aspx?filename=767&amp;file=annexe1  *5. persons with disabilities*  the issue of the disabled is very hard to research, because information on this topic is scarce. our original intention was to establish how disabled women or mothers with disabled children are treated in north korea and what kind of system of support is available to them. it has become apparent throughout the interviews that there are traditional social norms in north korea which allow for discrimination of this minority group. first of all, north koreans often reported that the person/family is ‚Äúcursed‚Äù if a disabled child is born into the family. north koreans have a common traditional saying that the person must have committed a crime in the ‚Äúprevious life‚Äù and thus the disabled and the family is being punished in ‚Äúpresent life‚Äù. there are no neutral words, such as ‚Äúperson with disability‚Äù used by north koreans. it is common to use derogatory terms toward various disabled groups in north korea, and north korean women reported that they learned that it is not proper to use such terms when re-settling in the south.  when asked about people with disabilities, north koreans gave us examples of people who lost their limbs in common accidents in factories and mines, blind or deaf-mute persons or persons with mental disorders. most had seen such disabled people in their environments and said they were very common in areas bordering china. only a few interviewed women attended schools or worked with mildly disabled persons, but all of them reported that they have never seen special infrastructure built for the needs of people with disabilities. they confirmed that there were separate schools or factories - especially for deaf-mute people. many of them were also aware of special hospitals for mentally disabled people in each province.  the situation got trickier when we asked questions about children born with genetic diseases. one female doctor who spent 30 years in practice said that ‚Äúgenetic disabilities are very rare; such children are not being born in north korea.‚Äù this is quite an unusual statement, because disabled people are born everywhere in the world and genetic disorders, such as down syndrome are quite common (1 child in less than 1,000 births). furthermore, there were few north korean women who had similar opinion that disabled children are not commonly born in north korea. according to experts, contemporary research on the relationship between poverty and disability suggest that poor diet and stressful living conditions increase the chances of premature birth and low birth weight, which may be indicators of future disability. given the fact that north korean women experienced nutritional deficiencies over prolonged period of time and commonly suffer from chronic untreated health problems, this must affect the health of the children born to those mothers. thus, the north korean doctor‚Äôs statement may be an indication that either the doctors are poorly trained and are not able to recognize many genetic disorders, or that children with disabilities are not under special medical care. doctors know neither about the number, nor type of defects of those who survived and are hidden at homes. the doctor herself explained to us that she saw a young adult with genetic disorder only once and it was at home of a person with very privileged background, who was also very rich. nobody was aware that this family had a disabled member because he was kept indoors and never received medical treatment in the nearby hospital, but the disabled person was well taken care of due to the parents‚Äô wealth.  lack of awareness of various genetic diseases and lack of medical access to identify mother‚Äôs health issues or early defects in fetuses leads parents to resort to various drastic measures when the child is born with obvious disabilities. because of the social discrimination as well as lack of economic conditions to raise these children, many interviewed women said that parents decide to kill the disabled child or abandon the child if they are informed at the hospital that the child will be disabled. the doctors usually inform the parents that placing a child face down will cause quick death from suffocation. 15) it seems that the trend became more common after the time of great hunger in north korea because those children would limit family‚Äôs mobility which substantially increased with a development of private economy.  women reported that the severely disabled are usually confined to their homes, so people may not even know about such cases in their neighborhood. in north korea, there are no welfare centers which would have specialized protection systems for those born with the disabilities. special places for people with dwarfism or disabled people in north korea has been mentioned since the 1990s. a rumor that disabled are sent to ‚Äúsome island‚Äù was sometimes cited among north korean women we interviewed. hearing commonly that parents decide to send away the child ‚Äúto a special place‚Äù we decided to ask those who could have more information about this procedure, especially people formerly in higher ranks in the people‚Äôs safety agency (police) or government. it was reported to us that in case a family has a problem with the disabled and wants to find a solution, they might seek help locally from the boanwon safety officer (police). it was reported that the police might help to send the disabled child away if it is burdensome for the family, or if an adult person constitutes a threat to the family due to for example dangerous behavior caused by mental disability. the police would inform the family that such option exists and prepare necessary documents. then the disabled person will be sent away for good.  one official of the people‚Äôs safety agency (police) also reported that there is an island with ‚Äúhospital 83‚Äù (under administration of south hamgyong province) to which disabled persons are being sent for medical tests such as dissection of body parts, as well as tests of biological and chemical weapons. he said that the average citizen will not know about this fact, they might think that the disabled are sent to secluded places. parents either voluntary give away the child or the agency in charge proposes to the parents to give the child away. it was also reported that it is very difficult for pyongyang citizens to keep disabled children at home. if the fact is discovered, the family will be expelled. the parents or guardians need to sign documents giving up the rights to the child. the id number associated with the person will be deleted. 16) the island where disabled people are sent is reportedly completely secluded. apart from the island, our interviewee reported of a long-term reform through labor detention (correction center), gyohwaso no. 1 in kaechon where disabled are often sent to. another person with a police background in north korea reported that a similar institution practicing chemical and biological tests on disabled and criminals is in a secluded mountainous area of north hamgyong province, from where two healthy people (criminals) allegedly escaped spreading information about the tests.  since similar reports have long been mentioned by various groups and media, we are of the opinion that there should be an investigation conducted by the international community to establish more evidence on reported existence of eugenic practices. we told the male interviewee from pyongyang that more disabled people have been observed on the streets of pyongyang, which caused visible amusement. he claimed that reality is totally different, but ‚Äúthe international community sees only a tie attached to the person‚Äôs front, and cannot judge whether it‚Äôs real or what‚Äôs attached to the person‚Äôs back.‚Äù

355649,"i did some research on this in my cyborg anthropology class in university, and there are actually legitimate concerns surrounding cochlear implants. as much as the cultural genocide argument is taken to a far extreme, it's not entirely baseless - deaf adults, like all disabled adults, rely on a support network distributed throughout the culture in which they exist. the visually impaired are not societally disabled because glasses are readily available, and the blind are able to live because of the prevalence of braille, seeing eye dogs, and the social support systems for blind people in the modern day. similarly, deaf people rely on access to translators, sign language education, and other support systems. the concerns around cochlear implants are rooted in two things: one, cochlear implants very very often do not grant hearing equivalent to that of a normally auditorily capable person - a person with cochlear implants like that generally isn't afforded the same education as someone with no hearing, and winds up being doubly disabled - incapable of communicating proficiently with both hearing and deaf people - instead of only having one disability. the second concern is that as cochlear implants become more common, the educational resources that make deaf adults capable of living easier, more fulfilling lives might be phased out - if, for example, there someday are perfect cochlear implants administered to all deaf kids, and there is no longer a need for sign language education, then it stands to reason that there will also be a last person who signs, a last group of people who can't communicate with anyone else but themselves. this is not to say that kids shouldn't have access to cochlear implants - however, the situation is much more complicated than is immediately apparent, and does deserve some serious discussion",1,,1

926822,"hi! first of all, i blocked the guy so i'm unsure if i am now answering in a thread i can't see or sending you a pm.   when you want to understand the special education system in the netherlands it is important to know we have socialised healthcare. this is important because healthcare is deeply ingrained with a lot of forms of special education here. healthcare and schooling are both free, meaning money isn't an issue when choosing a school here. not for anyone.  we started from a place of segregation (70's/80's/90's): any child with a physical or mental disability, or severe behavioural problems (like adhd/autism) has a specialised schooltype. generally, there are schools (both primary and secondary) for kids with a physical disability, a cognitive disability, a combination, or behavioural problems. the groups are much smaller there (10 kids maximum) and there is in-school healthcare and (physical) therapy if needed. this system is still largely in place, but we have been moving in the direction of integrating this in regular education. one way they do that is by having kids go to a regular school half the week and a special ed school the other half.  i was in regular primary education, but was in the same class as a girl with down's (this was in the 90's). she was on our school fulltime, with special supports. 2 classes higher was a girl in a wheelchair. she went half/half.   for the last 10 years the government has heavily started to endorse this approach. school aides are specially educated on special needs students. they get supports finetuned to what they need. the goal is to get students engaged in regular school life and curriculum as much as possible. children are only segregated now when their (mental) health or someone else's health is endangered (for example, when a child needs heavy medical supports due to medication/inability to use the bathroom/severe forms of epilepsy etc).   that's when they go to a special ed school, where they receive a tailored curriculum on their level, but following the regular school curriculum as much as possible. kids will receive physical therapy during school hours. for example, my youngest brother was both physically and mentally handicapped. he'd receive physical therapy on school time, as well as get specially tailored swimming classes, there were actual nurses around to manage his medications, help him use the bathroom (he used a catheter), do all kinds of medical stuff needed to keep him and his classmates healthy. this wouldn't be possible in a regular school setting, so he attended a school for children with physical and cognitive handicaps.   the tailoring the curriculum is an important aspect here. oftentimes, kids are judged on their weakest ability, then receive schooling on that level for all subjects. but with kids with a disability, their development path is often disharmornic. my brother was very good at language. at 11 years old, we found out he had taught himself english! my mom notified his school and the week after he started his first english schoolwork. at the same age though, he still did grade one arithmatic. emotionally, he functioned on the level of a kindergartner.  then my other brother, he is on the autism spectrum. his behaviour got worse over time. at first he succeeded with in-school aide and therapy after school. later his behaviour got worse and he attacked classmates. that's when he was moved to a special ed school for kids with autism. he felt much more at peace there, received social supports with the rest of his classmates. there was more attention for sensory and social challenges the students faced and the school was built and furnished accordingly. the school curriculum was exactly the same as at a regular school though.  then me. i got halfway to secondary school without problems. then i got bad mental health problems (without proper diagnosis), got two years in with a school aide but then dropped out. i went to a special ed school, which was basically garbage as it was more for those on extremely low levels, and i was on the highest secondary school level (dutch secondary school has different ""difficulties""). the teachers weren't really teachers (they literally didn't have a teaching grade) and they couldn't help me with my schoolwork as they never went to that school level themselves. the problem for me was my high intelligence (there's still a very stubborn prejudice that disability can't go together with intelligence, hence most special ed secondary schools don't offer the highest levels) and my lack of a label. i found out at 24 i am autistic too, but we didn't know that back then so they dumped me in a sort of ""you don't fit anywhere, so we put you in the bin with those that don't fit anywhere else either""-school.  now this system isn't perfect. i already mentioned the lack of higher school levels in special ed secondary schools. but also, it's real difficult to get your kid on a special ed school. my autistic brother had to spent 2 years in the kindergarten groups as a ""class aide"" when he was 8/9 because there wasn't space in a special ed school and giving him responsibility over kindergartners was the only way to keep him from hitting his peers. classes in regular education are often too big for teachers and teacher's aides to give proper support to kids with behavioural problems or learning disabilities, meaning they are more likely to get severe problems and get segregated anyway  we are learning as a society though. there is notably less prejudice about disabled kids now as there was back then. though wheelchairs and the like are still a novelty to able-bodied kids, they won't usually have to pick up their jaw off the floor anymore like they did in the 90's. there is much more emphasis on assuming competence in kids, and enabling them to show that competence. you ain't gonna teach a blind kid how to read with regular print! you gotta enable them by teaching them braille. whereas 50 years ago they'd just assume a dyslexic kid dumb because they couldn't read. turns out dyslexic kids *can* read if you give them more time and more chances to practice.   these are just examples from my personal experience. we have many forms for special education. in my (for americans small) city there's a school for blind kids, deaf kids, kids with behavioural problems, kids with autism, kids with learning disabilities. and those are just the ones i know because i regularly pass by them.  people say ""don't judge a fish by it's ability to climb a tree"" and though we still do that, at least we now understand that that fish is never gonna be able to do that if we don't give him an elevator to use or smt. instead of assuming the fish doesn't understand what ""climbing"" or ""tree"" means then shelving him as an idiot, we now give the fish the ability to show that he *does* understand, even though we know he'll never grow lungs, hands and feet and learn to climb as he does.",1,,2

989694,"transabled is analogous to transgender, it's people who ""identify"" as disabled or believe they were ""meant to be"" disabled in some way. and so some of them will attempt to acquire the disability they believe they were ""meant"" to have. in the meantime, they will do some degree of ""pretending,"" going out in wheelchairs or blindsimming or similar. some of them are ""full time,"" in the sense that they live their daily life from a wheelchair, but have no physical problems with walking at all.  interestingly enough, a good number of them are also transgender, such that their ""identity"" is that of a disabled woman.   there used to be a website devoted to this where people posted at length about their experiences and the entire scene, i probably read every post on it, lurked it every day for years until the owner of the site closed it down.  they too say the only thing that will fix their issues is surgery (amputate the legs they want gone, cut their spinal cord for those who want to be paralyzed, blind the people who want to be blind). in the meantime, the only psychological relief of sorts they get is via the ""pretending.""  they talk about getting ""ability reassignment surgery"" and the like. they talk about body maps, though no research there is conclusive.   yet the interesting thing is, you read far enough back, and yep, you can see where likely the imprinting happened, to cause them to have this obsession. and a lot of it is tied up in expectations, in feelings of responsibility, or wanting to escape this. (quite a few are also erotically into diapers and incontinence as well.)  they will say, it's not about wanting to be pitied. and they're right about that - it's more complicated, and interesting. but there's a good segment of people who have as their self-image someone who is ""sporty"" and fit and yet in the chair, someone who will go in a wheelchair faster than ""walkies"" are walking, who like to tweak the public's expectations by holding the door open for non-disabled people.  there was writing about going to the supermarket and revelling in the idea that they are pushing the cart around by themselves, not needing help.  ...because suddenly? ordinary activities are a challenge, and just by doing normal stuff, you're extraordinary. suddenly you've got this new challenge to probably distract you from your actual real personal problems.  there was writing about how terrible it is that some actual disabled people are not taking good care of their wheelchairs. like, if it were us, we'd do it properly. yep, that's a bit disturbing.  but how many times do we women hear the ""such a waste, born 'cis' and yet not dressing well, such a frump"" and the like? similarly disturbing. people would fetishize about rehab too.  but anyway the dynamics of people trying to join a marginalized group were all there. pretty fascinating stuff.   something else interesting to me were the specifically identity aspects. someone might have the ""identity"" of ""needing"" to be requiring a wheelchair for legs paralyzed at just this exact spot, etc, but if that wasn't possible for some activity or event, occasionally they'd go without, and yet - the interesting part! - still need to have some sort of shibboleth of being ""disabled,"" so ""at least using a crutch,"" or similar, because ""presenting as abled"" is the thing that would cause so much pain, being seen as just another regular non-disabled, able-bodied, member of the public.  one of the frequent posters on that old website was featured on national geographic taboo a while back.",1,-1,

233666,"i'm going to post my reply from a few other times this has come up.   i'm a sf/bay area landlord and have been through this a few times before with tenants, including taking it through court..  take all this with a grain of salt because ianal just a landlord.  i have successfully evicted tenants because they've gotten a puppy without telling me, then when i told them per the terms of their lease they has signed a no pets clause, they go out and get a letter from a doctor and try to pass it off as some sort of service dog/esa.  basically- there are a few different categories of ""service dog"" and they all tend to get lumped together because people (both tenants and landlord) aren't clear about the laws. it's a murky area and i've found even some housing attorneys aren't clear about it. also landlords tend to be in my experience very paranoid about the ada, so the minute someone says ""service dog"" or ""therapy dog"" they back right off and allow the tenant to move in/get the dog. we have a little more leeway than that. just be wary of googling about it because there is a lot of inaccurate information out there about the regulations and a lot of bs on the web about it. there are also a bunch of websites telling people how to fake qualify their dog as a bs service dog and sadly predatory scam places selling fake service dog credentials, harnesses etc for huge markups. it all really sucks for the people who actually need the service dogs, because all this makes landlords hella skeptical of anyone claiming to need a service dog.  **category 1: medical service dog**- dog provides a specific function for a specific disability. so, guide dog for a blind person, seizure alert dog for an epileptic person, hyperglycemic sniffing diabetic alert dog, stability support dog for an amputee, etc.  here is where it gets interesting and where a lot of the confusion comes from- as a housing provider, landlords are allowed to inquire about the nature of the disability and the specific function the dog provides the tenant to alleviate that disability. you can request proof of the disability. this can be a ssdi payment, etc. to warrant a service dog, the person has to qualify as disabled enough to no longer perform normal activities of daily living without the support of the dog. so, a trumped up letter from a doc saying tenant needs fido for his opiate addiction is not going to fly. it has to be a legitimate, verified disability... disabled enough not to perform normal activities of daily living. the dog does not have to be certified through an organization but you can request documentation about the tasks performed by and training of the dog.  what differs from landlords vs someone running a grocery store is because we are a housing provider, hud laws are different than ada laws... so basically if someone says they have a service dog in a restaurant, the restaurant owner can't inquire further, but a housing provider is allowed to request proof/documentation/verification yadda yadda.  another way a landlord can disqualify a bs service dog: even if the tenant has a documented disability and proof of requiring a service dog for a specific function, you can still prevent the dog based on breed restrictions. basically, the ada only requires landlords to allow the dog within ""reasonable accommodation"" and if allowing a service dog pitbull (or whatever breed they want if it's on the breed restricted list) is going to invalidate your building's insurance policy, you are still allowed to reject the disabled tenant and their dog. so in my case, i was allowed to reject an english bull terrier because they were on my insurance carriers aggressive breed list.  **category ii: emotional support animals**- doesn't have to be a dog. can be a cat, parrot, goat, whatever. these are animals whose mere presence helps alleviate mental illness. dogs not trained in any specific way, their function is to help emotional condition of owner. not protected by the ada or hud. this can be a depression dog or a ptsd dog, etc. landlords don't have to allow an emotional support animal. see more here.  **category iii: therapy animals/therapy dog** - these are dogs who are trained to provide therapeutic relief to other people than the owner... so for example if they took the dog and volunteered with it at an alzheimer ward of a skilled nursing facility. dogs are rigorously trained and verified by organizations like the delta society or the spca. not protected by ada or hud, don't have to allow them.  and all this is moot in certain cases...... i'm not saying everyone with a service dog is lying and trying to scam, but there are a lot of people around here who are. if i have a tenant with an actual legitimate disability, i will happily allow the service dog. currently i have two tenants with dogs- a hearing alert corgi for a deaf tenant in one of my properties and a veteran with a ptsd emotional support dog in another... it's more that i can't let every tom dick and harry who wants to get a dog decide to get one then make up some fake disability and try to pass the dog off.  if any lawyers or other landlords with more experience/knowledge about this want to chime in and correct me on anything, feel free!  i love dogs and used to allow them in all my buildings, but unfortunately too many irresponsible idiots ruined it for everyone else by not picking up their poop in the common areas and letting them bark inside of their units all day.   afaik there are no state specific laws regarding esas, only the national laws of ada/hud/fha. under ada/hud landlords do not have to allow emotional support animals unless the tenant is actually disabled by their mental illness. esas only qualify for reasonable accommodation if the tenant is so disabled by their mental illness that they are considered legally disabled- no longer able to hold a job or go to school, can't complete normal activities of daily living without the animal.  in order to qualify for reasonable accommodations due to disability, the tenant must meet the following conditions:  -  have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities (such as walking, seeing, working, cleaning, dressing, and so forth)  -  have a history such impairments  -  be regarded as having such impairments  here's the whole rule from hud if you want to get into the nitty gritty:  http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=servanimals_ntcfheo2013-01.pdf  my day job is an md and generally most doctors just want to help their patients, so it's super easy for a tenant to get a letter from a doctor to have an esa.  basically the tenant just asks nicely and they will write it.  which is unfortunate, but generally mds are coming from a place of caring/wanting to be helpful in whatever way they can and don't think it's their place to really say whether or not they think the tenant needs an esa... anyway, i'd take any doctors letter with a grain of salt.",1,,1

525388,"i have a neuro-immune disease that has left me moderately disabled. i find myself in the middle on this issue. if you're curious, i'm throwing my two cents out. i'm pretty worn out right now, but i think this should be fairly easy to follow -- just lengthy.  my disease started when i was in the 10th grade after i contracted mono. it's bad enough now that i don't often leave my house (maybe once a week, on average, and often that's to go grocery shopping with my wife).  i pushed through. my last two years of high school, i missed 1 of every 4 days of class. some days, i would be at home in bed, teaching myself the material for class, as i needed the rest and i was able to teach myself a day's worth of material in less time than i would have learned it in the classrooms. i was always swamped with work, rarely felt like my head was above water, and spent my weekends and holidays just trying to make sure i wasn't too far behind. still, i completed my work and did it well. i graduated a valedictorian, and i was also a national merit finalist.  i started off at my university's college of business. after 3 years (and on the dean's list), i realized my health was getting too bad for me to continue doing something i was not passionate about. the more i learned about business, economics, and finance, the more i grew to dislike the system. i checked out with the requirements for a business administration minor and headed for the english department. this put essentially all of the courses for my major crammed into the end of my 'academic career.' i got all a's within my major, received departmental scholarships/awards for both academics and creative writing, and just got an email today informing me that one of my extra classes from the college of business was approved as a substitute for the only remaining elective i needed. as of today, then, my requirements are finished. my academic career is over (unless a cure comes out sometime soon for my disease and i'm able to apply for a grad school), and it's finished with an overall 3.6 even though i missed a ridiculous number of classes. i just had to work harder outside the classroom when i had the health and mental energy to do so (and sometimes when i didn't).  without this disability, i know i could have accomplished more in college. in some ways, i am disappointed in myself, even though i don't believe i should be. the only honest way for me to judge myself is to incorporate my own 'overcoming' into the narrative of my accomplishments. here's where i think i see the difference.  i, personally, want others to take my disease into consideration when they judge what i have accomplished. if they don't, i might look like a lazy sack of shit or a deadbeat husband. i do *not*, however, want a trophy. i don't want a ceremony. i don't want a movie or a story that focuses on the disability. i just want a footnote or something. maybe an appendix in the back that someone can turn to if they happen to be interested.  most people with disabilities who do get offended seem to get offended more by things like open calls for pity at telethons to raise money for a disease or other disability. their offense about 'supercrip' stories takes a bit more investigation to understand, and i'm still personally rather torn on where i stand. in order to understand it, you must be willing to 'unlearn' what is considered 'normal' or 'superior.' there are some instances where i disagree with what i'm about to write (for example, with going blind), but others where i believe it is appropriate.  in the original image in question, a man is skating with a prosthetic leg. the fundamental, underlying assumption that must be made here is about the acceptance, and superiority, of the traditionally abled body. having a different leg is normal for this person. the guy probably would like to wake up in the morning and just go to one game not having to think about or hear about how many people are so in awe that a cripple is out on the ice! i mean holy shit, did you see that dude? no leg, and he's not just skating, he's fuckin' playing hockey! many of these people prefer to be referred to (or at least thought of) as ""differently"" abled rather than ""dis"" abled.  if you are in a wheelchair, and the only access to a building is the stairs, the handicap lies not in whatever condition has put you in the wheelchair (your disability), but in the social understanding that, ""well, most people can use stairs just fine, so we'll make this building accessible to *most* people."" the stairs themselves become the handicap. they are constructed for other members of society, and they are not constructed for you. the legal, cultural, and societal factors here have a role to play. how does the community feel about accommodating others whose abilities are different than 'normal?' are there legal requirements in the community for wheelchair ramps, parking spots, non-spherical doorknobs, etc.? the focus from this perspective chooses to emphasize the failure on society's behalf to make itself open and accessible for all by creating handicaps (i.e. stairs without ramps) for people rather than on the individual's failure to integrate into society because of his or her disability.  largely, i understand this, and i can agree with the sentiment. i take issue, however, with this ""differently abled"" rhetoric at some points. for example, if i go blind today, i'm going to be horrified. i will have lost an entire sense. no substitute (like a prosthetic leg) to allow me to pursue the same activities, but in a 'different' way. it's just gone. my reality would be drastically different, and it would take a very long time (i think) for me to accept and embrace that. i don't want to simply say that i'm now ""differently abled."" i'm not. when it comes to vision, i'm disabled. i'm un-abled. i'm non-abled. my ability to see isn't different; it's totally gone.  not a whole lot is known about my disease, but from what research has been done, i believe my brain essentially sends messages to my immune system that it's not supposed to be sending, and i end up with inflammation in my joints, in various tender spots on my body, and in my skull. this obviously leads to an array of symptoms. i've got a terrible headache now (i got out of bed after 2 sleepless hours, just to get my mind off my headache, which is probably why i'm writing so much now), and i want that to stop. this is something that is pretty objectively broken about me. i'd have to fight to find a redeeming quality about debilitating mental cloudiness and headaches.  as for your question about inspiration, i'd take issue more with the way the question was worded than anything else. the issue here isn't about feeling inspired. it's not about feelings at all; it's about actions. feeling inspired by that kid is totally different than showing a bunch of strangers his picture and saying, ""guys, check this out. dude with no legs is skating. i'll bet you don't have a better excuse for not skating. if **this guy** can do it, surely you can, right? get out there and skate, all you non-disabled bipeds!"" i'm making assumptions here, but that dude probably wouldn't be offended to find out that you were inspired by him; he *might* be offended if you made it a big deal, though, or if the first (or only) thing you talk to him is his leg should you get into a conversation with him.  like i said, i only partially ""get it,"" but that may be because the nature of my disability is different than most in that it is not immediately obvious to others unless they are around me for an extended period of time or i tell them. maybe i just haven't been personally impacted by it enough at this point to feel hurt by it as others are. i do, however, understand their need/desire to try and expose the underlying assumptions and messages they feel are communicated (usually inadvertently) through 'supercrip' tales.",1,,0

384037,"&gt; i guess my point is that, in situations where the incompetence of the victim is an issue, does the source of that incompetence matter? i interpreted your rhetorical question about the man on pcp to have as desired answer ""no"". my question is: why should this be so?  i don't think i'm skirting the issue at all, perhaps i can answer more completely.   there is not a victim, until there is a crime. so the first analysis needs to be: is there a victim at all?  there is not necessarily a victim in sex and the existence of alcohol does not make a victim present. to clearly state this point, let's take a really drunk man (for the time being forgetting about the state of the women). he aggressively (but not inappropriately) hits on a girl and is successful in catching her attention. he suggests to leave and she willingly comes with. they have sex, with him happy about it and encouraging it. the next morning he wakes up, remembering nothing and is not happy about what went down. was he raped?   does it matter if the gender's are reversed.  compare this with a similar situation of someone with dementia. same guy, same actions with a girl equally willing. was he raped? i am more likely to say yes.   so in the rape context, it absolutely matters what brought on the incapacitation.   the reason i started this with ""there is not a victim, until there is a crime,"" is because in the fraud context, there is a crime assumed. in a drunken sex romp, there is not one. so the analysis can't start with whether or not the source of the incompetence matters, but whether or not a crime occurred.   as an aside, there are laws specifically to protect the vulnerable to make actions against them (elderly, young and disabled) where a crime would not be with a normal person, even if drunk.   &gt; i guess my point is that, in situations where the incompetence of the victim is an issue, does the source of that incompetence matter?  with the above in mind, my answer is very clear that the incompetence does not matter, however the crime needs to be proved first. if the idea is that the incompetence makes a crime available, then certainly the source of the incompetence plays a big role, since this is the source of the alleged crime.   now, getting more general:   &gt; why should this be so?  i feel i answered this very fully with my above reference to the differences between dementia and drunkenness, but perhaps i can describe it more directly. i apologize for being verbose, but brevity was not a gift granted to me.  an important part of incompetence is that you are at a point where you are not responsible for your actions. this needs to be a 2 way street. in the dementia context, there is universal agreement that you are not responsible for your actions and that others must take care. a person with dementia stealing is forgiven and, likewise, having sex with a person with dementia is generally rape (they are incapable consenting or controlling themselves).   in the drunkeness context, we do not share this. you *are* responsible for your actions when drunk. if you steal, you are not forgiven for not knowing any better in your drunken state. the reason behind this is choice. you made the choice to get drunk and you will not be forgiven based on your inability to control. in fact, you will not find a single instance (outside of the alleged instance of sex) where you are no longer held responsible for your decisions when you are drunk.   in the sexual context, saying that someone was too drunk to consent is essentially saying that the are not responsible for their actions when drunk. it is saying that them saying yes and moving forward toward sex should be null and void because they were drunk. how is this different then their choice to get behind a car? to steal? or even more scary, how is this different then someone who gets drunk and rapes someone [edited the last one to say what i meant]? should they be forgiven because of their incompetence as a person with dementia would be?  the reason why this is ok is because they had the choice to drink. if they are drugged, then they were raped. if they were tricked (unordered heavy alcohol content) then they were raped. if they are forced, they are raped. the same result in an action should occur and be independent of inebriation.   am i still not answering the correct question?",1,,0

172964,"whether you are born with light skin or dark skin is entirely dependent on a set of genes that you receive from your parents, whether it be the original dark-skinned genes or the relatively newer lighter-skinned genes that make it easier to produce vitamin d at areas in the world that get less intense sunlight. if you were black, lived in an area of intense sunlight, and managed to whiten your skin, you would be actively removing your naturally excellent defense against damage from the sun.  if you replaced your native language with an international language, instead of just learning the international language in addition to your native language, you are now cutting off your ability to communicate with those that only speak your native tongue, which is also artificially hampering yourself.  left-handedness does not come up very often in terms of disadvantages, and those are borne of the larger relative population of right-handed people. so maybe you sort of have something here, except it's extremely weak since it requires essentially zero effort to ""adapt"" to being left-handed.  surgery and implants are all well and good to to lose weight (if you decide that you don't want to diet and exercise, or if you have a predisposition that makes that very difficult). if you are weak, that is either because you live a sedentary lifestyle, which is actively hampering yourself unless you actually don't need to be physically strong, or because you were born with a disease or other condition that makes you weak.  my point is that for everything you listed, the things you were trying to ""cure"" are either good adaptations in the first place (being dark-skinned), silly to even consider (willing to give up talking to one group of people to gain access to talking to a new group of people whom you likely have no need to interact with), sort of grasping at straws (left-handedness), or literally either an example of someone actively hampering themselves or having a disease that would actually be really great to cure (being overweight of your own accord, being predisposed to obesity, or having a disease or condition that makes you weak).  i understand that the deaf community is most certainly its own culture. i attend a college with a very large deaf community, and i see the way they interact, and their happiness, every day. but.   let's work with definitions here. the deaf community, by and large, claims that deafness is not a handicap and it is not a disability. the very common argument is ""we can do anything a hearing person can do, except hear!"" take a person who is very clearly disabled. a paraplegic who has been their entire life due to some defect that makes them unable to use their legs. they are just as intelligent as the next guy, let's say they're an excellent hobbyist artist, and they work as an engineer for a small company, because details. the guy does anything that some ""average"" fellow can do, except walk. or anything else one would do with their legs. the blind guy can do anything anyone else can do except see. the amputee can do anything anyone else can do except hold things with his left hand while he opens the door for his girlfriend, because he doesn't have one.   the ability to hear is extremely useful literally all the time. at no point, save for situations like terrible screeching sounds, have i ever wished i could not hear, and even then it was only temporary, and really it wasn't that i didn't want to hear, it was that i wanted that one specific sound to stop soon please. if you cannot hear, then it is harder to get your attention at a distance. if you cannot hear, then you cannot listen for your name during roll-call. if you cannot hear, then your child's crying may go unnoticed in situations where a response must be immediate. if you cannot see, you miss out on the beauty of color in the world. if you cannot see, you are in danger of falling victim to any of the great and varied silent threats in the world. if you cannot taste, the magic of food is lost on you forever. if you cannot smell, you may very well quietly die in a house with a gas leak. if you cannot feel, then the ability to react to pain, the ability to react to pleasure, and the ability to react to everything in between are lost on you.  deafness does not get a special category just because a good number of deaf people decided that if you got enough people to say it, everyone else would have to stop saying it was a disability or risk offending them. you can make anything you want to be ""politically correct"". that's easy to do. you just need enough people. but to actually believe in your heart that you do not have a handicap because you can do anything a hearing person can do, except hear, is lying to yourself in the most basic form. being able to hear is not just a pleasure. it is not like owning a ferrari instead of an economy car. it is not some extra thing that some people have because they like nice things. it is something that the overwhelming majority of the population has the ability to do, and so much so that nearly all of our entertainment, safety, and work-environments are entirely based around sound and verbal language. you communicate with sign-language because you have to. if you were hearing and did not need to learn sign-language, you wouldn't. it, purely by the virtue of the way it is, is a less fit method of communication that speaking. you have to communicate that way, and so you do.  i am not trying to be a jerk. at all. i empathize with the deaf community just as much as the next guy. but to claim that you do not have a handicap, and then try to defend that argument by saying a bunch of things that are wildly inaccurate, is absurd and uncalled for.   you have a handicap because if you could hear, you would be more effective at life. this is, unarguably, completely true. if ever once in your entire life for even one second you would have been benefited by being able to hear, then my argument has been made. you are supposed to be born with the ability to hear, and if you are not, then you are missing an ability you are supposed to have. period. not having an ability you should have means you can't do things they can. if you can do anything a hearing person can, except hear, that's fine, but you still *can't hear*.   and as an aside to another hotly debated thing about the deaf community. being able to hear is an ability. to choose to make your child unable to hear is turning off that ability. turning off an ability is disabling it. **you are giving your child a disability if you make them unable to hear when they normally would have been able to.**  so finally, for cochlear implants, if you *actively do not allow your child to receive one, or by actively looking down upon and shunning your brethren for receiving one, then you are actively promoting maintaining a disability to maintain your identity.*",1,,-2

119891,"autism is a spectrum, and intelligence is difficult to gauge absolutely, but there are many types of mental retardation. i think it's impossible to deny that brain damage or developmental difficulties can lead to severe mental impairment.  that's all people mean when they insult one another by calling one another retarded. the ""insult structure"" is more than common, it's a template known by seemingly everyone. people get mad about someone's behavior when they expect more from them - that's the only time that people blame one another for things, when they think the person being blamed is responsible and ought to have acted differently. and so they try to think of circumstances that would excuse the behavior and remove responsibility from the person making the mistakes, and then sarcastically ask if the person is in those circumstances (or angrily assert that they are). consider the following:  * you didn't see the stop light? are you blind?! * i've been repeating myself all night! you're going to have to start learning sign language. * you can't remember the conversation at all? did you get hit on the head or something? * stop standing around like a couple of morons, and get some work done! * he didn't know the panama canal was in panama? that's retarded.  now then. my problem with your argument is that, as far as i can tell, all of the above statements are equivalent - that is, if the last statement is wrong to say, absolutely all of the other statements are wrong to say. they all do the same thing:  * _are you blind?_ - blind people aren't second class citizens, but being blind is an obvious circumstance that would absolve someone of the responsibility of seeing a light. yelling this at a blind person would be a faux pas, naturally. note that there are many other reasons why one might not see a light, and that some visually impaired people might miss the light, or might see the light - if the question had been ""are you visually impaired?"" then it would not have implied that _all_ visually impaired people _cannot_ see such lights, just that visual impairment can cause one to fail to see the light. * _you're going to have to start learning sign language_ - deaf people aren't second class citizens either, but being deaf would excuse someone for having missed parts of a conversation for sure. using this makes the most sense when you think the person missed what you said out of inattentiveness, and therefore has nothing to do with ""hearing skills"" at all, but i think a lot of people literally get mad at one another for having impaired hearing to certain degrees. * _did you get hit on the head or something?_ - this is literally analogous to asking someone if they're retarded. the speaker is suggesting circumstances that would absolve the person of responsibility, namely, mental impairment due to traumatic head injury. this is every bit as bad as asking someone if they were dropped as a baby - in both cases the questioner is suggesting that the person's actions could be explained by _brain damage._ when people call one another retarded, they mean mental impairment due to either damage or developmental difficulties. this is literally the same suggestion. * _stop standing around like a couple of morons_ - words like ""moron"" and ""idiot"" have been used as medical terms, and are every bit as offensive as retarded by any analysis. (moron does or did refer to someone with an iq in the range of 50-69; idiot was once used to describe someone whose mental age was that of a three year old.) incidentally, you were wondering if there was an intelligence department. there is. it's the medical profession. i understand your point about intelligence being difficult to pin down and i agree with you. i anticipate your lambasting of the iq scale and i agree with you. none of this changes the fact that yes, there are people who have been trying to gauge and classify these things since medicine was invented. they do not deal in polite equivalences, and they can describe in a variety of ways how types of brain damage or developmental abnormalities can give someone challenges as far as intelligence goes. * _that's retarded_ - and so here we are. does this statement imply that no autistic people, or brain damaged people, or developmentally disabled people could possibly know where the panama canal is? no. it implies that mental retardation could very well prevent someone from learning or understanding this fact, and since it is being applied to someone who isn't mentally retarded, it implies that the person lacks any excuse and deserves blame for not knowing it. does this express mental retardation, by which i mean brain damage or developmental impairment, in a negative light? yes. brain damage and developmental impairment are negative things, and no matter how one tries to argue that intelligence cannot be gauged and people with certain disabilities may not be disadvantaged in many respects, we can be safely assured that the parents of brain damaged or developmentally disabled children would remove the damage or correct the development if they could - they do not see their child's retardation as ""different, but just as good"" as a lack thereof. that mental retardation is on the whole a negative trait is a fact. that it could cause someone to lack basic geographical knowledge is a fact. as with all the other jokes or insults, the statement only applies to the deficiency demonstrated by the individual (not knowing where the panama canal is) and only applies to them because they are not, in fact, retarded.  so? are they all equally offensive? or are they all equally an integral part of the way human beings interact? i end up leaning toward the latter.",1,,
224838,"the fact that you have cp still doesn't mean what you say is relevant to all disabilities (i mean, i have a disability that has no problems with intervention, especially in young children. if i extrapolated from that and said that disabled people favor intervention, that would be othering and silencing to the deaf community, so i don't do that).  one thing that came up is the use of the word 'impaired'. while what you've said in this discussion applies to deaf people (i have no desire to question or invalidate that) and people with cp, as somebody with a disability who identifies myself with an 'impaired' marker, i find it problematic to state that it's catagorically harmful/bad/wrong, and to tell able-bodied people not to use it. it may be harmful/bad/wrong *within your communities*, but statements that the use of impaired language are psychologically bad or reinforce notions of inferiority don't sit well with me because i and others in my community identify with those markers.  i fully realize that wasn't the desired outcome or intention of the discussion, but in a lot of these discussions i as a blind/visually-impaired person end up having to decide whether to jump in and talk (and go close to de-railing, which i dislike doing) or not say anything and let statements/theories/ways of thinking which are problematic to my experience as a disabled person pass by because we don't easily fit in the proper rhetoric.",1,,1
175821,"hi.  i am suffering from a similar condition except for the 'coming off' part.  i have ushers syndrome.    whether or not anything can be done depends on your particular condition.  in my case, there is nothing they can do to prevent eventual complete blindness.    the length of time between conditions vary too.  usher's moves along very slowly.  retintis pigmentosa is similar but moves along faster.  i think for both conditions protiens that preserve the health of the retina aren't being manufactured by the body, so the retina cells slowly die.  my condition shows up as blotchy regions on the retina.  i don't think they come off.  however, i think i did have some 'floaters.'    i have pictures of my retina.  it looks like some kid took a magnifying glass on a hot day to them.  weird thing is that some spots are white.    in any case... vitamin a (carrots) is shown to slow down the progress of my condition.  i dunno if that is true for you.  as far as career options, you may be limited.  in my case, i decided to switch to the legal field.  i was an engineer that worked around very high voltages.  so i had to change my career.  switching careers might be something you should consider.    there is a demand for patent attorneys... particularly in the software engineering side of things.  if you are an engineering transplant (i.e., got an engineering degree but do programming), then you should really consider it.  i bit of practical advice, don't go running to your employer with the information.  just go about as normal.  even if you trust your current boss, you may lose him in the future.  then the new boss might find out and fire you.  however, you really should trust you instincts.  just be aware that the response of others are going to be very unpredictable.    all those redditors out there that wanna say this is against the law and the eeoc (or your country's equivalent) will do something about it... you are wrong.  the best that is going to happen is that some attorney will make a cool 20 grand off of it.  the eeoc isn't full of gung ho attorneys ready to kick some ass for the disabled.  this is from personal experience.  sorry.  as far as continuing as a programmer, i really don't know. from other comments, this sounds feasible.  if you are american then i suggest that you start looking into the ssdi asap.  you may already qualify as legally blind.  it sounds like you would qualify under the field of vision test.  you have to have 20% or less (there ssdi has an intricate formula that you should understand) to qualify under the field test.  i suggest that you do your own homework and do not believe what anyone else says except your own attorney.  make sure you find someone who is experienced in ssdi issues specifically.  a lot can ride on understanding of the soc. sec. practice.    the benefits for blind people are different and more significant than other disabled.  also, the social security office will provide vocational rehab services if you cannot find work in programming (if you need to).  also, the state has vocational rehab programs that will pay for you to retrain into something you can do.    oh yea... if you condition is slow and you are young... then there is a lot of hope on the horizon.  stem cells and gene therapy trials are coming up.  there is an incredible amount of progress being made.    also, once you start needing benefits and accommodations keep your head up if you start encountering some negative attitudes.  you will likely start to encounter condescending behavior from others.  don't talk to your family or the non-disabled about this stuff unless they are really special.  most people will not understand or take advantage of it.    for example, my wife kept leaving stuff on the floor... not just a few things... but a lot of stuff for me to trip over.  some even start bitching about the 'special treatment' you are getting.  a coworker of mine was complaining about my special treatment because my employer bought me a 'special monitor.'  yet, there are no special monitors, just better monitors with better brightness ratings.  in another example, one counselor suggest that i sweep floors for a living.  this is someone that doesn't know how to open pdfs.  so you see, some do not understand the improvements that technology has made in the disabled's employability.    you see what i am saying?  so when you encounter this stuff you will have to keep them happy so you just continue smiling and whatnot.  you will encounter a lot of it.... more than i expected when i started going blind.  if you are not lucky and are surrounded by extrodinary people, you will have to work to keep from becoming angry.  you will have to learn to keep faith with monty python's ""always look on the bright side of life.""  i suggest viktor frankl's ""man's search for meaning.""  it sort of explains why people respond the way they do to your issue.    if you don't believe me about the huge prejudice you are going to face once you need some assistance, then you can read some of the comments re sec. 8 (e.g., housing employee with a bumper sticker ""if you can't feed them, don't breed them"").  there is widespread popular support for this perspective of government assistance.  the idea that 'breeding' is a condescending term that rips respect from the recipient is lost on them.  most recipients are recipients for a reason beyond their control.  there really is nothing you can do about this.  i know this sounds negative and discouraging.  i am not trying to do this.  i am just telling you this in spite of the expected downmods because it is the best advice i can give from a practical advice point of view.  you really will have to learn to respond positively to everything because you have no choice.    in the end you will grow as a human being... not because of the phenomenon of losing your vision but what comes with it.  if you wish to donate for reseach then go to [blindness.org](http://blindness.org/).  i think the founder is running a double or triple your donation campaign.  the founder is blind himself and runs a tight ship.  i think it has one of the smallest operations costs to funding ratio of any non-profits (it gets the money where to go extremely efficiently).  under this matching program, if you donate a buck... hell make it two or three bucks.  however, it may already be over.  i really hope this helps.  i wish i had gotten this advice before i embarked on my life changing quest.  the key point is that people will change their behavior to you and they won't realize it.  no amount of talking will change their mind.    good luck!  :)  (edited to correct grammar and to clarify some points)",1,,2

(9) i am a housing provider and just don‚Äôt believe what people tell me without proof. can i ask for details about the disability or request medical records?   hud does not allow housing providers to seek personal and private details of a person‚Äôs medical history. hud states that ‚Äú\[d\]isclosure of details about the diagnosis or severity of a disability or medical records or a medical examination cannot be required.‚Äù   (10) what about documentation from the internet? is that sufficient to show that someone is disabled from something like depression or ptsd?   it depends, according to hud. a housing provider is entitled to request reliable documentation related to the disability. because of the presence of numerous web-based providers that issue assistance animal ‚Äúregistrations‚Äù and ‚Äúcertificates‚Äù after a short interview for a fee, hud states the following:   **in hud‚Äôs experience, such documentation from the internet is not, by itself, sufficient to reliably establish that an individual has a non-observable disability or disability-related need for an assistance animal.**   fheo-2020-01 at page 11.   documentation from a medical provider that has an established relationship with the person seeking the accommodation would be much more reliable. in the present covid pandemic, many patients have switched to remote visits with their medical and mental health providers. thus, there is apt to be less face-to-face interaction between providers and those seeking accommodations since 2020. hud notes that licensed, medical professionals can deliver services remotely and deliver reliable documentation.""

795952,"lots of good but problematic thoughts here.    &gt;by accommodations, i am not referring to disability benefits or even specifically employment, but rather society doing what it possibly can to make autistic and other disabled people included as fully as possible in society.  sure, who wouldn't agree with this?  until, that is, you actually filter it through a critical lens.  ""society doing what it possibly can"" to make people ""included"" is an extremely vague, variable, and potentially all-consuming goal. just as small example, to make the world fully inclusive for (let's say) quadriplegic people would cost hundreds of billions of dollars and would ultimately be less-than-fully functional for non-impaired people. now multiply this process by every disability you can imagine.  my point is that you're engaging in idealistic rhetoric, but reality is always going to be informed by what's possible--and what's possible is always going to be bounded by dirty, gritty things like financial costs, fairness to the majority, and so on. reasonable public accommodations are good; vague, unrealistic vision statements are not.   &gt;i believe we should expand the definition of normal to include many disabilities.  cool, but same thing: what does this mean?  they're called disabilities for a reason, and that reason isn't simply oppressive power rhetoric by the self-declared ""normals.""  a blind person is impaired, not just a ""different normal.""  a handicapped person is impaired.  a deaf person is impaired. a developmentally delayed person is impaired.  not being able to see, walk, hear, or reason at an adult level sucks. it's one thing to claim that the blind/deaf/handicapped are equally human to everyone else.  of course!  it's another thing entirely--and something i oppose--to push for rhetorical normalcy at the expense of effective cures and treatments.   &gt;i don't want my tendency to fixate on things and self-stimulate or the culture i have (without even trying, a lot of my friends are autistic or neurodivergent in some way) to go away or be under attack.  that's your choice, but it should be a private choice.  opposing medical progress in the realm of cures and treatments because you're worried people might stigmatize your stimming is selfish and uncaring towards those whose autism is more severe than yours (or who might *not* enjoy their tendencies to fixate, etc.). i know i'm being matter-of-fact here, but only in the name of clarity.   &gt;i don't want people to completely ignore my needs because ""you can make those needs go away"" and people view bullying me as acceptable because ""you refuse to fix the 'real problem'.""  bullying is never acceptable, but i'd like you to think about the rest of your comment a bit more deeply. imagine an obese person whose doctor says he could avoid cholesterol meds and impending heart disease (which is very expensive for the public health system) if he cuts back on calories. (thousands of doctors say this every year to millions of patients--it's an epidemic in the u.s.). the patient refuses, saying that he loves rich foods too much, hates exercise too much, and doesn't want people to ignore his needs just because he could make them go away if he wanted. can we agree that this guy is being selfish?  that he can eat all the pizza he wants, but he isn't entitled to special benefits (e.g., disability if he's too fat to get off his couch and work, larger seats on public transit, government-subsidized cholesterol meds)?  that he shouldn't be bullied, but also that society shouldn't be rebuilt to suit his abnormal needs because there are alternatives for which he, not us, should be responsible?  in a hypothetical world with a cure for autism, how is your situation different?  why would you be entitled to special accommodations in this case?  &gt;if i were to get disability benefits, it would be for my bipolar disorder (which i do want cured, but i respect bipolar people who don't want a cure), not my autism.  genuinely curious--why is it acceptable to cure/treat bipolar disorder but not autism?",1,,-1

984263,"oh, okay.   well, i was born blind in one eye and deaf in one ear, which meant that i had really balls equilibrium. because it's all facial paralysis-related stuff, part of my tongue was also paralyzed. i had difficulties learning how to walk and talk, though i clearly was an intelligent child based on how quickly i grasped concepts. (for example: i don't remember learning to read. i learned to read at such a young age with no instruction that i just sort of always knew how) when i entered the special needs preschool, i walked with such a pronounced shuffle/limp that i needed physical therapy. i couldn't run as fast as the other kids and overall moved like someone with cerebral palsy on half their body. reading this, i wouldn't be surprised if i just had a rather mild and unusual case of cerebral palsy, though my medical file doesn't indicate this.  i remember doing a lot of physical therapy, and going to preschool for an additional year. i loved my teachers, though i got impatient because i was lumped in with all the special-needs kids regardless of their level of functioning. there were several kids who were high-functioning like myself but needed assistance, and several in varying levels of low-functioning. being taught how to read was the worst, since i was already reading babysitters club and the boxcar children. i also did speech therapy, which was mostly just repeating sounds and words until i spoke correctly.   overall it was pretty fun, though i confess my memories on them were limited. somehow i got pegged as the ""retarded kid"" in elementary school because i went to the grade above me for reading classes and was still doing some speech therapy. the kids saw my paralyzed face and somewhat slurred speech and assumed the worst. i ended speech therapy in the second grade, i believe? i liked speech therapy a lot, actually. we played games and did therapy, so it was great. the teasing stopped after i was placed in the highly capable classes for obvious reasons.  overall it was a good experience, and consider it extremely beneficial. i speak in a highly enunciated way. aside from some long-lasting clumsiness (that is largely due to a malformed inner ear and lack of depth perception and not because of inability to walk), i can move about like your average person. nowadays if you were to meet me in-person you wouldn't be able to tell i had ever done special education at any point in my life, though there's roughly a 30% chance you'd ask impertinent questions about my facial paralysis.   tl;dr: did special needs stuff, now virtually indistinguishable from normally-functioning people.",1,,1

798228,"i found a very insightful analysis in the ny times from dec. 19 that validates what you said in certain respects, libs0n. i'm reposting the article here in its entirety because i really think it explains things as objectively as possible given the emotionally charged nature of the conflict. i hope my fellow redditors will take a moment to read it and better appreciate the grievances of both sides.   &gt; jerusalem ‚Äî rockets are flying from gaza into southern israeli communities again. israeli warplanes are firing missiles back, and israel is closing the crossings through which food and fuel are supplied. the united nations agency that feeds palestinian refugees in gaza says its stocks of flour are exhausted.  &gt; in other words, the six-month truce that israel and hamas, the militant palestinian leaders of gaza, agreed to on june 19 is over. on friday, hamas officially declared in a statement that the ceasefire had expired, saying the truce would not be renewed because israel was failing to fulfill its ‚Äúfundamental conditions and obligations.‚Äù the end of the truce was greeted by relative calm, with only a scattering of rocket attacks and no major israeli military activity. officials and analysts on both sides say that things are likely to deteriorate further in the short term, but that both sides need the truce, so they will probably grope their way back to it. the question is how soon and after how much suffering.  &gt; israel and hamas accuse each other of bad faith and of violations of the egyptian-mediated accord, and each side has a point. rockets from gaza never stopped entirely during the truce, and israel never allowed a major renewed flow of goods into gaza, crippling its economy. this is at least partly because the agreement had no mutually agreed text or enforcement mechanism; neither side wanted to grant the legitimacy to the other that such a document would imply.  &gt; ‚Äúi think it is going to get a lot worse before it gets better,‚Äù remarked robert a. pastor, who has been traveling in the region with former president jimmy carter, meeting with hamas and other officials. ‚Äúit did lead to a significant reduction in the number of rockets fired at israel until november, but the truce had less impact on the goods going in. one hopes both sides learn lessons and agree on a text and publicize it.‚Äù  &gt; there seems little likelihood of that happening soon. hamas considers israel an illegitimate state and is doctrinally committed to its destruction, while israel views hamas as a terrorist group that must be dismantled. yet each needs the other to hold its fire. that is why negotiations over another truce have started, again through egypt.  &gt; hamas officials say it was their understanding at the time that two weeks after the june 19 accord took effect israel would open the crossings and allow the transfer of goods that had been banned or restricted after june 2007, when hamas waged a violent takeover of gaza.  &gt; their job, the hamas officials said, was to stop the rocket attacks on israel not only from its own armed groups, but also from others based in gaza, including islamic jihad and al aksa martyrs brigades.   &gt; it took some days, but they were largely successful. hamas imposed its will and even imprisoned some of those who were firing rockets. israeli and united nations figures show that while more than 300 rockets were fired into israel in may, 10 to 20 were fired in july, depending on who was counting and whether mortar rounds were included. in august, 10 to 30 were fired, and in september, 5 to 10.  &gt; but the goods shipments, while up some 25 to 30 percent and including a mix of more items, never began to approach what hamas thought it was going to get: a return to the 500 to 600 truckloads delivered daily before the closing, including appliances, construction materials and other goods essential for life beyond mere survival. instead, the number of trucks increased to around 90 from around 70.  &gt; israeli officials acknowledged that transferring previously banned goods had been the plan, but said that there was no specific date for the increase and that it was to happen in steps. but the rockets never fully stopped.  &gt; ‚Äúthe palestinians wanted to have one or two rockets a week to keep our people in tension and still tell people inside gaza, ‚Äòsee, we continue to fight and we continue to bring in goods,‚Äô‚Äù said shlomo dror, chief spokesman for israel‚Äôs defense ministry. ‚Äúthe moment we fail to react to one rocket we encourage them. our only choice was to close the crossings when rockets came in.‚Äù  &gt; in addition, israeli forces continued to attack hamas and other militants in the west bank, prompting palestinian militants in gaza to fire rockets. the israeli military also found several dozen improvised explosive devices used against its vehicles on the gaza border and about a dozen cases of sniper fire from gaza directed at its forces.  &gt; while this back-and-forth did not topple the agreement, israel‚Äôs decision in early november to destroy a tunnel hamas had been digging near the border drove the cycle of violence to a much higher level. israel says the tunnel could have been dug only for the purpose of trying to seize a soldier, like cpl. gilad shalit, the israeli held by hamas for the past two and a half years. israel‚Äôs attack on the tunnel killed six hamas militants, and each side has stepped up attacks since.  &gt; israel was actually hoping that the agreement would lead to progress on corporal shalit‚Äôs release, or at least to increased information on his condition or negotiations over an exchange for him. but hamas said the shalit case was entirely separate from the accord, just as israel had rejected the request by hamas to have the truce suspend attacks on its men in the west bank. there, too, hamas had hopes that the accord would create some changes that did not take place.  &gt; israel‚Äôs focus on corporal shalit and hamas‚Äôs focus on the west bank are examples of why the agreement, without a text or enforcement mechanism, has been so problematic, with each side relying on its own desires rather than on mutually agreed steps. but given each side‚Äôs refusal to acknowledge the other‚Äôs legitimacy, another such accord of winks and nods seems the likely outcome of any coming negotiations.   http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/20/world/middleeast/20gaza.html",0,,

376979,"i didn't know how to share this article, it's subscriber only and i can't get it to work on archive  rita panahi: meryl streep inside toxic hollywood cloud   rita panahi, herald sun  january 11, 2017 6:01am  subscriber only   hollywood‚Äôs moral compass has always been askew. that tends to happen when you mix enormous incomes, unchecked adulation and rampant drug abuse with a smug world view born of privilege.   the same folk who celebrate a child rapist like director roman polanski are sickened that the american people dared elect a candidate they don‚Äôt like.  meryl streep had no qualms about giving polanski ‚Äî who drugged and anally raped a 13-year-old and then fled to france to escape justice ‚Äî a standing ovation when he won an oscar for the pianist in 2003, and has spoken of her sorrow for his plight.  streep was preaching to the converted on monday when she delivered an elegant but vacuous rant that was dripping in hypocrisy and hyperbole.  in decrying president-elect donald trump during her acceptance speech at the golden globes, streep indulged in disingenuous victim playing and baseless scaremongering.  from painting the film industry and the media as the ‚Äúmost vilified segments of american society‚Äù to insinuating that trump intended to deport scores of foreigners regardless of their legal status.  after naming several foreign-born actors, all in the us legally, streep said: ‚Äúhollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners and if we kick them all out, you‚Äôll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.‚Äù  never mind how conceited that statement is but it‚Äôs also utterly untrue and unprincipled.  if streep were genuinely concerned about foreigners facing deportation then she‚Äôd call out the man who has deported more foreigners than any other president in us history; hollywood darling barack obama.  as the ‚Äúdeporter in chief‚Äù, obama‚Äôs administration has deported more than 2.5 million people between 2009 and 2015. that astounding figure doesn‚Äôt include the numbers deported in obama‚Äôs final year in office.  by the way, meryl, you‚Äôll find far more diversity in the mma and football than on most hollywood films.  but she wasn‚Äôt finished there; streep then launched into an impassioned plea on behalf of the downtrodden, denouncing trump‚Äôs bullyboy tactics in mocking a disabled reporter.  ‚Äúthere was one performance this year that stunned me. it sank its hooks in my heart,‚Äù she said.  ‚Äúit ... it kind of broke my heart when i saw it and i still can‚Äôt get it out my head because it wasn‚Äôt in a movie. it was real life.‚Äù  except the incident didn‚Äôt happen this year, it occurred on the campaign trail in 2015, and has since been debunked in the eyes of many as a storm in a teacup.  it would be deplorable if trump knowingly mocked a disabled man for his disabilities but it appears that‚Äôs not what happened at all.  indeed, trump has a habit of flailing his arms around when mocking his opponents, who are, typically, able-bodied, and there is plenty of footage of him behaving in this uncouth manner.  it seems highly unlikely that he was aware of the journalist‚Äôs physical handicap when he mocked him during a speech.  streep‚Äôs most poignant line of the night was the following:  ‚Äúdisrespect invites disrespect. violence incites violence. when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.‚Äù  sadly, it was also the most hypocritical. hollywood‚Äôs rich and powerful are known to exclude and punish ideological opponents, ie, conservatives.  and if streep really wants to speak out on behalf of the disabled and disempowered, then she could‚Äôve mentioned the hate crime that came to light last week.  four anti-trump african-americans kidnapped a disabled white man who was subjected to hideous cruelty over 24 hours. the torture and humiliation of this man was recorded and shared on facebook. during the prolonged assault in a chicago residence, the suspects are heard yelling, ‚Äúf--- donald trump! f--- white people!‚Äù, as they kick and cut their victim and forced him to crawl on all fours and drink from the toilet.  can you imagine the worldwide furore if four trump supporters had kidnapped a special needs african-american man and tortured him on video while yelling anti-black, anti-clinton slurs?  it would lead to protests, riots and saturation media coverage where trump and republicans would be blamed for creating an atmosphere of hate and violence.  but the violence sparked by the hyperbolic nonsense aimed at trump and his supporters is rarely examined by the left-leaning media.  we were told that it would be trump voters who wouldn‚Äôt accept an election loss and would resort to violence but it‚Äôs been clinton‚Äôs supporters who have trashed cities and beaten innocent people in politically motivated assaults.  the celebrity and media classes who campaigned relentlessly against trump appear incapable of accepting reality.  of course streep‚Äôs tone-deaf speech was applauded by like-minded celebrities and media who seem hellbent on maintaining an almighty post-election tantrum.  their prolonged hissy fit shows only how entitled and out of touch they are with the mainstream, both republican and democrat, who have accepted the election result.  it must be hard not to be smug and petulant when you‚Äôre acclaimed as a rare genius for regurgitating someone else‚Äôs words.  the same hollywood community that celebrates child rapists and wife bashers feels entitled to tell americans how to think and who to vote for.  there‚Äôs an argentinian expression, ‚Äúvivir en una nube de pedo‚Äù. the literal translation is  ‚Äúto live on a cloud made of farts‚Äù but it‚Äôs used to describe those who are out of touch with reality.  i can think of no finer description for the hollywood elite.  rita.panahi@news.com.au  @ritapanahi",1,,0

334149,"okay, so here's the thing. language is important. we understand our world through words. we use them to construct narratives with which we understand and draw meaning from our experience and relate it to others. but the narratives we construct don't just work with and for us, they work *on* us in various ways. they affect what people are able to see as real, as possible, and as worth doing.  the language of our culture is full of metaphors about disability. they're everywhere, and they are almost always pejorative. think about it: crippled, lame, paralyzed, retarded, schizophrenic, deaf, dumb, blind, idiot, moron, imbecile, crazy, insane, lunatic, psycho, spaz. it's kind of incredible, when you think about it, how often we use language which draws on a particular narrative about disability. it's a narrative which propagates negative and disempowering views of disabled people, which is destructive to them, and which resonates with the centuries of social and political violence that disabled people have had inflicted on them (if you want to know more about this, check out the [disability social history project](http://www.disabilityhistory.org/). if a culture's language is full of these pejorative metaphors about disability, then it not only says something about how that culture views disability, but it helps perpetuate that view. it helps perpetuate the stereotype that being able-bodied is ""normal"" and ""better"", that there is something deeply wrong with being disabled.  this is what's wrong with using this sort of language. when it comes down to it, it's not really about personal offense (although, trying not to say hurtful things when it can be easily avoided is a good way of not being an asshole), it's about being aware of the political and social impact that our language can have. the use of disability-related/ableist slurs adds to the narrative that disabled people are wrong, broken, dangerous, pitiful, or tragic.",1,,1

death of the mother. you may be unaware that any pregnancy comes with a risk of death and sometimes it can be a [complete surprise.](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/criog/2012/951480/)  &gt;**sudden death of a pregnant woman in third trimester with no risk factor**   acute myocardial infarction is very rare in women of reproductive age, but the risk is increased by pregnancy. approximately 0.4‚Äì4% of all pregnancies are complicated by cardiovascular disease, and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction is estimated as 0.6 to one in 10,000 pregnancies with the highest incidence in women over the age of 30.  most pro-lifers make an exception for health concerns, but not everyone faces a condition that can be diagnosed by doctors ahead of time and prevented. this woman entered the hospital at 4:00pm complaining of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. about 8 hours later she was dead.  no one should have to take that risk except by choice. you might find the risk negligible, but what level of risk of *death* is acceptable to you? what if a woman with a health condition has a 5% risk of death? 10%? keep in mind, that with the scale we're talking about here -- the number of unwanted pregnancies -- what you're determining here is how many unlucky women *will* die, not just how many risk death. a 5% chance means hundreds or thousands of women with that condition will die every year. and what of the women who will be permanently crippled? what if they were housekeepers or landscapers or made their living on some other physically-demanding, low-income job? what if they already have children they need to clothe and feed?  and what happens to the unwanted children?  there are an estimated 1.2 million abortions in the united states every year. you probably consider that a massacre. let's suppose abortion were illegal. and to give you a big advantage, let's say that because abortion is illegal people start being more responsible and cut the number of unwanted pregnancies by **95%**. also, i'm not going to include the current rate of abandoned children in my calculations. that means we have just 60,000 unwanted babies born every year, all of whom would have been aborted.  in 2013 38,200 children 4 years of age or younger were waiting to be adopted. that same year, only 29,000 children 5 years or younger were adopted. imagine we add those 60,000 unwanted children to the system. in 5 years the number of children 5 or younger waiting for adoption will swell **4 times** its size to 164,200. this means kids without homes, without funding for an adequate education or housing, overworked foster care agents who can't give them the time or attention they deserve, more children slipping through the cracks and landing in abusive homes, an entire generation of severely underprivileged, emotionally neglected, forgotten kids. these kids, the kids you want to be born, will be able to feel sadness and loneliness and pain. is that worth it to you? to literally *create suffering* where none need exist?  and remember, for your sake i blinked *95%* of abortions out of the equation. what if it's less than that? only 90% of people prevent or keep unwanted pregnancies? 464,000 unwanted children. 70%? 1,664,200 homeless children in **just 5 years**.  can you imagine the tragedies our nation would face if you got your way *and* we saw a whopping 70% decrease in unwanted pregnancies? can you comprehend the situation you're advocating for?  a fetus cannot feel pain. it cannot comprehend its existence. it is literally incapable of suffering. making abortion illegal would create suffering. it would subject hundreds of thousands of thinking, feeling kids to the knowledge that they are unwanted and unloved. it would absolutely cripple our systems of adoption and foster care. the quality of life for *all* children in the system would drop. we would probably have to cut support for system youths at 15 or so in order to try and cope with the massive demands of a generation of forgotten children. education rates drop, crime rises. realistically, more unwanted pregnancies are conceived by the children we lose track of or send off to fend for themselves.  now if you ask any ""almost aborted"" or adopted individual whether they're glad they lived, i'm sure they are. they grew up in a system where we *kinda* manage to take care of our children. they were not 1 in 1.6 million kids our government desperately tries to feed, educate and house.  so if you want to talk about how every life is sacred and how ending any life is murder, but the reality of the situation is that if i stomp on a jellyfish i will spare 164,000-1.6 million children the scraps our government would be able to provide for them, **i

""jesse gets hot fuck sandwich"" froze again as it reached the meagre limit of its loading potential and i changed windows to see if ""sasha first time cumgoblin fuckstick extravaganza"" had loaded (sometimes i think those redtube titles are created by a bot that just inserts the word ""fuck"" into everyday sentences. seriously... ""bitch gets fuckbath she deserves"", anyone?).  so i go to switch between windows when a flickery glob appears in the middle of my screen. i click at it angrily a few times and it disappears, so i forget about it instantly and continue what i was doing, which entailed pulling my penis and sweating, and sometimes both.  about 20 seconds of aggressive masturbation later and the sound resolved itself once more, but this time instead of the usual ""i love your cock in my pussy!"" exclamation it sounded like a harried and struggling voice calling my name.  ""peter. peter!""  as if that wasn't offputting enough, the voice sounded familiar. like, a very bad kind of familiar. like, the kind of voice that says ""have a good day at school, dear!"" or ""i laid out your jammies and made you some toast, hun.""  mum?  i minimised both windows and it took me some five seconds to realise what i was seeing. at the end of ten seconds, i had learned a number of valuable lessons.  these lessons include:  1. when your mother calls you on skype, the ""answer"" button pops up on top of whatever windows are playing, but if it's a full screen video then the ""answer"" button can be flashing and illegible.  2. when you enable webcam calling, the webcam engages as soon as the call is answered.  3. when your mother calls you, only to find you masturbating vigorously in a dark room to what sounds like the mutant offspring of an air conditioning unit and a transformer, she will have trouble looking you in the eye for the remainder of the call.  4. a fully erect penis can become flaccid in 0.2 seconds when shown a small image of its mother, looking pale and asking ""what on earth are you doing?""  having made all of these discoveries, i closed skype and sat on my computer, in some combination of horror, shame and precum. i put a shirt on and tried to return the call. mum answered, but had disabled her webcam and could only manage ""call back when you're ready dear, i'm just going out"". i haven't called back.  the look your mother gives you when she sees you masturbating on webcam is unlike any i have seen before, but this is a case where, i would say, ignorance is bliss.  the moral of the story? there isn't one. i'm an idiot.",0,,

701334,"80% seems unreasonably high for all of humanity, and probably even too high for cultures that actively *promote* consanguinity; today, 50% is around the upper limit among the most interbreeding-intense communities and they're usually far from flourishing.  there is, after all, a reason why our ancestors practiced patrilocality and many people today have an innate, and otherwise inexplicable, disgust associated with the idea of incest.  so although it's true that studies have found cousin-marriages only have a 2-3% greater risk of birth defects, such a restrictive criteria provides only a glimpse at the full scale of deleterious consequences that is all too often entails from consanguineous marriages.  below is further information about the topic from a similar discussion.  ------------------------------------------------   calculations derived from 1,854 cousin marriages in japan has shown that the inbreeding depression from first-cousins' children is equivalent to five iq points (0.33 standard deviation)^1.  on a normal distribution, this would represent a relative decline of between 9% to 17%, with the average being 13%.  to give these numbers some perspective, five points is usually smaller‚Äîsometimes, as you'll see, significantly so‚Äîthan the difference in mean iq scores between any two races/ethnicities in america (for a particularly stark example, the gap separating african-americans and jewish-americans is fully 28 points)^2.  so obviously this is far from a debilitating effect and‚Äîneglecting the fact that intelligence cannot be accurately measured in newborns, and isn't even considered stabilized until after puberty‚Äîwould never by itself warrant defective status.  and, of course, although the world is growing more cognitively demanding every day, intelligence is only one of numerable traits that determines one's success and quality of life.  however, the ramifications of this study are far more extensive than merely inbreeding depression's effect on intelligence.  its implications are that *any* trait which is variable within a population due to genetic differences has a *possibility* to be adversely effected by inbreeding depression, albeit not necessarily as consistently and to an equal extent as intelligence contingent on each trait's unique heritability, its polygenic degree, the vagaries of recombination, and i'm sure many other technical factors.  so in other words, the consequences of incest cannot simply be reduced to a comparison of birth defect rates.  numerous other harmful effects are almost inevitable, and although they may not be as discernible and explicit as a serious birth defect, their cumulative effects can place an unnecessary toll on the cousins' hypothetical child.  these unnecessary effects can, obviously, easily be avoided by not reproducing with close kin, but, as you hinted at above, one shouldn't also neglect other more mundane possible sources of harm such as alcohol, tobacco, et cetera.   ---------------------------------------------------------------  **follow-up**   &gt;not to mention those in the study were from the nuclear ravaged areas of japan  [valid point, however, both the control and experimental groups came from the same regions.  given the sample size, there's really no other explanation than inbreeding depression for the consistent discrepancies between the two.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1706139/?page=1)   &gt;no telling what lead to so much consanguinous mating &gt;perhaps the problem was not that of the inbred population, but of what lead to the inbreeding itself.  i believe it's generally acknowledged that these consanguinous marriages are cultural in nature.

334995,"i think political correctness is a bit out of hand, i'm a minority (disabled) so i'll relate some of the points i favour and don't in relation to what you say; (i'm profoundly deaf btw).  firstly, there are some things that absolutely shouldn't be said, they're outdated terms that are particularly offensive. for example, they used to go around calling deaf people (or deaf-mutes) 'deaf and dumb', say that to me or any other deaf person and you're liable to provoke a very aggressive respond.  however, i notice a lot of politically correct 'terms' are championed, somewhat ironically, by the 'majority' who simply don't understand the impact of what that term has. for example, deaf people have their own culture, mostly due to the communication barrier, they identify as 'deaf', they don't identify as the hearing like to put it as 'hearing impaired'. in fact, that term pisses me and plenty of others in the community off, we're not 'impaired', we're deaf, end off.  the problem is though, is those who do champion a cause tend to be very blind to the wider picture, instead focusing on narrow goals, perhaps supported by evidence that supports their views and not necessarily evidence of the views of the full community.  what i'm trying to say is, there has to be a balance between avoiding terms that are out and out offensive for a particular group, to going so far the other way you're not really representing them anymore. a lot of political correctness has gone too far in one direction, on top of that, the movement for 'equality' often focuses on singular aspects, so say female rights, or ethnic representation, but only ever skim the surface of the issue; see, token black guy representation in movies and whatnot, it is skin deep, satisfies some equality tick but doesn't really represent a particular culture or group or individual from a group.   that's why i shake my head a lot at politically inspired (or otherwise) equality activism, because a lot of the times it isn't all-encompassing, people jostle for gender-equality, sexuality-equality and whatnot but ignore things like disability-equality, and then you get things just making the minority net 'wider' by adding things like diabetes as an equality 'right'.  basically, i think people need to stop for a minute and do things the 'deaf' way in some respects; that is, celebrate our differences, there's not always a need to be the same, there's not always a need to 'check your privilege'. those who buy-in to differences, accept them and celebrate them while being inclusive are the ideal people, but they're a rarity as a lot of issues just drop into a slanging match.  an example; a co-worker of mine was always inclusive towards deaf people, but we thought we'd show him what the reality was, we took him to a deaf club (no speech, sign language only) and he said it was eye-opening how difficult it was for him to access the community, because essentially it was role reversal. he took up learning the language to get involved, and the deaf group tried their best via writing/talking in the mean time. obviously we can't do that for things like gender or sexuality in the same way, but i do think there are methods to get involved that will open up eyes to certain aspects that would promote camaraderie and friendlieness without political correctness interfering; god knows the pc brigade would have had a field day if they caught one black guy who used to do the 'smile and you can see me' joke at work, especially if any white person mentioned it outside of work, that's wrong imo, because it's all done in the spirit of people bonding and having fun and recognising that yeah, we're different, is that such a bad thing?  nb: just in case; i don't condone racism, sexism or any kind of discrimination, it exists, sure, and it's fucking hurtful when it happens - i should know, but inclusiveness is the answer not pc or the latest fad 'trend' from social campaigners.",1,,1

917687,"if i may, it seems like you‚Äôre focused on writing the physiological attributes to a character rather than their personality.   am i correct on that?  if so, then i understand everything until your conclusion. i dislike when people write about deaf people who has an ugly speaking voice and they can‚Äôt hear anything because...well, that‚Äôs not how deafness works. disabilities and disorders are spiderwebs and everyone might have to live with what they have, but they go through varying levels and strings.  and this goes for every marginalized group. the technical aspects bother me when authors who aren‚Äôt anywhere near a character‚Äôs physical or neurological attributes or culture or lifestyle somehow portray it in the worst possible way.  from black to bdsm, from autism to adhd, from sexuality to schizophrenia, somehow, authors manage to do the least amount of research into learning the true spiderwebs of lifestyles, conditions, skin tones, and attraction. not every gay or lesbian is a femme or a masc. not every black person has a drawl. not every bisexual is some poly cheater. not every person with ocd is just ‚Äúvery clean‚Äù. not every person in bdsm is some abuser or the victim or abuse. and not every quadriplegic has to use a powered wheelchair and is completely paralyzed.  instead of reaching out to people who live differently than themselves or doing extensive research, writers go off what they know, and that isn‚Äôt a lot. and it becomes so harmful when they have a character who is deaf or mute suddenly hear or speak again and now you have committed erasure to an entire community into thinking how they live is incorrect and needs to be fixed. or my god, literally making every ‚Äúgood race‚Äù or ‚Äúmorally gray‚Äù race white and oh crap the villains be tan to black because lawdy we are straight up villains.  (in my bioethics class long ago, we actually discussed about genetic altering of an embryo and if parents should have the right to give them ‚Äúsuccessful children‚Äù meaning sans any birthing defects or disabilities, and that discussion was heated.)  if researchers could do a little more investigative research in the expansive range each difference acclimates and better understand the daily life that person may go through (my dyscalculia forces me to type in a phone number 3-4 times since i confuse a lot of numbers), then diversity among characters would be well received. my blind neighbor can also see shapes and does not have a guide dog. my deaf friend and i go hard when we listen to bass heavy songs (and she still speaks because she practices and sings and her voice is very nice). my deaf flute student is wonderful. i taught her prior to her hearing being reduced since i‚Äôm very sensitive to vibrations and i teach her to this day. my adhd friend is friggen smart as heck and goes to mit.  don‚Äôt buy into stereotypes. do the research. and also, if a character lives with a condition or likes certain people or all people, or has a cultural background in this or practices qigong, whateva, announce it. don‚Äôt hint at it and then once the series is done ‚Äúah ha! for you see, they were xxx all along!). you have now further more diminished that community because oh now we have your attention since we are a 2021 trend. i see. i see.  now.  that being said.  please do not romanticize our lives and make it seem like we are just one attribute.  i am black. i am bi. i am disabled.  okay, but i cosplay, i love disney, i am learning japanese, i am a cat mom, and i really, reeeeeaaally hate the outdoors.  my former description are external layers people can perceive by just looking at me. (i‚Äôm told i give off big bi energy, but i‚Äôm chaotic so i like that vibe). the latter is my personality once you sit down with me.  now yes i do things differently than other people. i have a special cane for my cosplay (i cosplay as dc character who has used a cane in the past, so score!). i can‚Äôt move around without heavy exhaustion, so i‚Äôm a homebody. and i do ensure racist people, open fetishizing of my race, misogyny‚Äîthe list goes on.  but i am human.  i have a personality.  don‚Äôt reduce me to a black disabled person and then just fridge me and only introduce me whenever racism comes up. my white friends already out here trying to make it seem like blacks are racial justice warriors. please shut up. authors, stop doing that to us do, that is harmful. especially in some fantasy world. why would you make racism happen in a fantasy world where magic exists?  write people as people because we are people. nikita dragun is transgender, but she is problematic. trans people can be problematic, shockingly, but they can be kind as heck. why? because they are people. i am not a fan of a few wealthy black celebrities. yeah, we‚Äôre all black, but they abuse their power, so nope, don‚Äôt like you. odd i don‚Äôt like people of my own community, you say? not really since they are people who can do bad actions as much as they can do good. my friend is in remission for her cancer, but when things were rough, she wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcancer warrior‚Äù. to be honest (and she admits it) she was ashamed of her entitled behavior and later apologized to me and many others for how she acted. (she sort of extorted people and lied and emotionally manipulated people and everyone was afraid to stand up to her because she had cancer and didn‚Äôt want to be labeled as ‚Äúthat person who bullied someone with cancer‚Äù).   okay, yeah, we‚Äôre not all societal norms. yeah, some of us are damaged, some of us can‚Äôt walk correctly, some of us have nursing aides, and some of us are hiv pos (which i wish people wrote more about), some of have catheters, and some of us aren‚Äôt literate.   but we are human beings.  in my rebuttal to your conclusion, i‚Äôd ask writers to stop romanticizing differences and, instead, properly learn about them. take the time to understand how to bring up certain topics and incorporate in your writing the littler things that people of different lives may have to do that is separate from the norm rather than outright throw it in the face of someone.  starting changing the tropes you have put on differences and make people have a personality. don‚Äôt limit to a trope. by limiting yourself, you have forced an innocent character into an inescapable box and influenced people to only see them in that box. certain things people live with might limit certain activities, but it doesn‚Äôt make them inept nor have a need for a cure.  honestly, if you have never read the mutants/x men, i‚Äôd give it a read when it comes to portrayal of differences. yes, it‚Äôs about people with powers who may or may not have other difference such as blindness, deafness, mobility issues, or what have you. but i do love the social aspect about how they portray differences in people. you have ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people saying ‚Äúcure them of their powers, they are diseased!‚Äù and you have people who say ‚Äúmutants are people too and deserve rights and i‚Äôm an ally‚Äù. you have mutants who question their self worth and value due to the limitations their differences present and others succeed even with any physical mutations.  granted, x men can be problematic like anything else, but i certainly felt at home reading about their stories. a story about outsiders by outsiders. it doesn‚Äôt get everything right, but it does portray the hardships and differences in a way i can get behind.  it‚Äôs unfair to limit an author‚Äôs writing to what they know because, lo and behold, the world is not like them (thank goodness). we would have a hive mindset for that to happen.  we meet people with differences everyday. it‚Äôs natural to write about them in the world. now, don‚Äôt be the next aladdin and just mash a bunch of cultures into some blurred mess, don‚Äôt be lion king and make it seem like the savannah is all there is in africa, and don‚Äôt be like ignorant people and somehow forget the middle east is part of asia (though a friend from india denies he is asian, but eh, that discussion is fierce) and taiwan and thailand are very different.  write about the world as it is.  you can make your villain gay. but does them being gay have to be a sole characteristic to who they are? you can make someone albino. but albino people come in all colors, so is it fair to make them pale and red eyed and have photophobia and that‚Äôs all you emphasize on? you can have a deaf character. but is it fair to reduce them as ‚Äúthe deaf character‚Äù who is socially inept and can‚Äôt hear anything?  people are different. respect those difference and still give them a personality. people are flawed. people have issues. people can be cruel and people can be vicious. people can be loving and people can be fair. people can be blind or gnc or nepalese or live with did.  but most of all, people are people.  and their personalities are a spiderweb of possibilities, just like any other attribute.  though, thanks for your discussion. sorry for the words. this‚Äôll be buried in the comment section for sure.  for the record, this is my opinion and it may not have come off as eloquent as i hoped. i will amend a statement if it is offensive to someone because i don‚Äôt mean to offend anyone. please know that.  peace.   *tl;dr: in the technical aspects of people‚Äôs differences and experiences, i agree with the end of romanticism and the start of thorough research to end preconceived notions on a certain difference from the norm. however, the world is a diverse spiderweb of differences and experiences. unless your work is some mono-race fantasy and adheres to your society‚Äôs version of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù with no variation of any kind, we should always write how the world is a place rich of different types of life and personalities.*",1,,1
115470,"&gt; f you werent such an arrogant asshole...shit, its beginning to look like you're a high functioning retard.  your response is with minimal substances and mostly just an attack at me, yet i'm somehow a retard? i can form a sentence without using an explicative and fortunately this allows for an appearance of a discussion. lets hope you can form a more coherent and focused response next time.  &gt; adhd is irrelevant. a learning disability is just that, a learning disability; its a politically correct term to refer to a broad spectrum of disability, possibly even mild retardation.  whats your point? you seemed to have been in a rush to attack me to make much sense here. i think i can guess that you meant to say that the girl didn't have a learning disability at all or possibly that adhd is a learning disablity. hard to tell what you meant, so i can't really respond to this.  &gt; not all retarded people are vegetative droolers but in fact very high functioning.  so we agree that some retarded people are incapable of performing text messaging. see we are making progress here!  however we seem to disagree on a higher functioning mentally retarded persons interests and capabilities for electronic text messaging. do you have anything to substantiate this claim?  &gt; think 7 year old in an 18 year old body. as in talking. in complete sentences. and transcribing said messages in text. maybe even in electronic text.  actually we're not discussing simply an ability to write a text message, but also the inclination to type thousands of messages. it would be hard to associate the entire constellation of attributes exhibited to equate to a mentally disabled person.  that would be like suggesting that a mentally disabled person would make the effort to join a discussion such as this to simply throw out random insults. it doesn't follow that this would be a purposeful action, maybe it would be from an ignorant person, but not a mentally disabled one.",1,,-2
194372,"if that's the case, blame shit on the black-eyed peas, and defend amurrica and derpy derp freedom durr hurr free speech!  (so high right now...brace yourself.)  ------  at an old job i once had, one of my superiors would always use the phrase ""if you will.""  now, that phrase is normally used to make a concession in a sentence; one could say something along the lines of, ""he wasn't a very honest person, a liar if you will.""  doing so accepts that the listener may think of the person as a liar, but does not fully commit the speaker to that position.  used correctly, it is a useful idiom that allows one to speak his or her mind without directly offending anyone.  i liken it to the phrase, ""no offense, but..."" before saying something particularly scathing.  however, my superior did not use the phrase correctly; instead, she would use the phrase simply to say the same thing a different way.  for example, she would tell us to ""sign our name here; write your signature, if you will.""  i secretly thought that she used the phrase to sound smart, and i took offense to her attempts to talk down on those people who worked under her.  i cringe when i hear that phrase now, even if it's used correctly.  i especially dislike when people use the phrase ""if you will"" incorrectly, as my boss had.  when i read your email, that phrase immediately jumped out at me, even tough you may be using it correctly (from what i understand, ""intellectually disabled"" more accurately describes special needs children with significantly below-average cognitive ability, rather than children with emotional or psychological disabilities).  you could not have known that i hate the phrase ""if you will.""  it seems like such a benign saying, one that couldn't make anybody upset.  my point here is that we cannot possibly know the effect of our words on everyone who might read them, especially in a place as public as the internet.  i have talked to many friends about your email and how i should respond.  most of my friends saw no problems with the original comic; they correctly identified the fake phone number as the title and chorus of the popular black-eyed peas song, ""let's get retarded,"" in which the term does not refer to the special needs community at all, but rather is a popular saying indicating the desire to get drunk and party.  i find the song to be incredibly dull, repetitive, and devoid of any social or musical value.  though i have not polled my readers, i strongly feel that many of them would agree.  to link that song and its pointlessness to customer service seemed natural, and i felt that adding the portrait of a blonde girl (another stereotype some may take offense to) would cement the entire image not as one demeaning the special needs community, but one that clearly represents my disdain for customer service (especially taken as a whole with everything else on the page).  however, if i were to curb my speech to appease everyone who could potentially become offended, especially in a forum as public and free as the internet, i quite simply could not write anything.  i would not have even been able to post the comic in the first place, for fear of offending people who actualy work in customer service.  intentionally attempting to censor the word ""retard"" in any form, be it implying that a person should take a post down, change a drawing, apologize for their speech, or (worst of all) become too timid to post it in the first place, it only makes the problem worse, as it cements the word as derogatory and hurtful.  yes, if left unchecked, the word may come to mean ""stupid"" like you believe, ""drunk and partying"" like the black-eyed peas think, or someone who is mentally deficient.    but, to use an alternative to something you've suggested, isn't that the exact way the word ""dumb"" has developed over time?  furthermore, wouldn't it be preferable to describe mentally retarded people in a more narrow and specific way, by using more proper terms like ""intellectually disabled"" or ""developmentally disabled?""  wouldn't it be more worthwhile to use the opportunity to educate people on the various specific forms of mental retardation, rather than to close off all avenues of communication about the subject?  while i appreciate your feedback, and have enjoyed the introspection it has brought me, i will not apologize for my satirical viewpoints on customer service.  likewise, i also will not expect you to apologize for your use of the phrase ""if you will.""  every person views life with a unique viewpoint; you came to my website with the perspective of a special needs parent, while i viewed your email with the perspective of a person who had a really awful boss once upon a time.  but the difference between us is that i refuse to automatically take offense to what you've written.  rather than respond with a knee-jerk email in anger, i have taken the time to analyze my feelings and develop a response.  i welcome seemingly-controvertial things i may see, especially in a place as free and public as the internet.  if we as a people are never challenged, how can we grow as human beings?  how can we explore topics that may seem controvertial if they are never presented to us?  though you may take offense to things you see in the future, just remember to take some time out to think before you respond.  had you looked deeper than the mere mention of the word ""retarded,"" you would have seen that i did not mean it to insult those people with mental disabilities at all, but rather to simply draw a link between customer service and a horrible black-eyed peas song.  instead of expressing anger about the subject, you could have turned those feelings into a positive post (perhaps on your own blog) about the differences between various forms of mental retardation and how they differ from the ""party definition"" used in common speech today.  to suggest that i censor my own speech to avoid offending anybody in the future only promotes more knee-jerk reactions to that which angers us, rather than fostering an understanding of problems that arise in an ever-changing world.  to blindly fight for censorship is selfish, short-sighted, and detrimental to our society as a whole.  retarded, if you will.  sincerely,  giantbatfart  ------  it needs a tl;dr, but fuck that.  she deserves it.",1,,-1

202310,"i mean, yes, but this is all coming from what has been an ongoing effort to give people with disabilities, diseases, conditions, etc. a notion of self-worth and dignity in the face of a society that, for a long time, essentially viewed them as freaks and inherently *incapable* and even *damaging* to that society as a whole.  i know it's not *directly* comparable, but look, for example, to people living with hiv/aids.  in the late 70s and on through the 80s, people with hiv/aids were absolutely marginalized and demonized, given little to no respect, support, or effective medical care, and when truly effective medical care wasn't available, support for finding it was generally withheld or given only very hesitantly by public and private institutions because the disease was seen as a marker of degenerates, undesirables, and people who were more or less a drain on society rather than a boon to it.  in the 90s, there was an increased effort, along with the advances in hiv/aids medication and treatment, to help people with the disease regain a sense of self-worth, which basically produced the, ""you can live a healthy, productive life even if you have hiv/aids,"" mentality.  and it's true, you can.  but you still have hiv/aids, and that still makes you generally *less* healthy than people without it and requires you to take more precautions, regularly take very strong, expensive medication, etc. etc.  the problem is that many have latched on so strongly to that notion of not acknowledging that people with hiv/aids are ""diseased"" because they don't want to devalue them as people that we are getting to the point where we can't make effective headway against preventing new infections because people see it as ""manageable"", essentially as ""not a big deal"", when in actuality it *is a really big fucking deal.*  now, obviously deafness and hiv/aids are not similar in many, many ways; deafness isn't a communicable disease, it doesn't kill you, it doesn't cause your body to waste away, and it doesn't require medication to keep you alive and to make you less likely to spread it to others (because it can't be spread).  *however*, the social movements surrounding the two are somewhat comparable in that there has been a push for decades and decades and decades to portray the disabled, such as those who are deaf (or, say, paraplegics, etc.), as perfectly functional and productive members of society in reaction to centuries of very real marginalization.  and this is a good effort, generally speaking, because if the hearing-impaired can function relatively normally in society, then that's awesome, and it gives them a sense of self-worth and confidence that they are not limited by what many people see as a big problem.  the issue here is that these movements have essentially swung *too far* in the opposite direction.  just like with hiv+ people who see the disease as really ""no big deal"" that doesn't affect their life in any really meaningful way, it seems as though many deaf people have latched onto this idea that being deaf is essentially *no different* from being hearing in any significant way, except that it comes with its own subculture and portion of society (making it actually pretty significantly different).  so it *is* different, but, according to them, not in a *bad* way, just in a *different* way, and implying that it's somehow worse or more difficult or different in any way other than just a generic, equal difference is akin to marginalizing them.  so yeah, i would hesitate to say that being deaf or hearing-impaired is *debilitating*, but i would also say that it very definitely makes one's life *more difficult*, and that deaf people are *objectively lacking* a significant sense that *most other people have*.  does that make them worse?  no.  does that mean they have a ""problem that needs to be fixed""?  not necessarily.  but i think the advent of small, easy-to-use, effective hearing aids and implants is not simply the product of hearing people imposing their desires on the hearing-impaired; there is obviously some heavy demand for this stuff from hearing-impaired people themselves, and i think that the pendulum of identity has swung so far in favor of subculture positivity that many hearing-impaired people see those who want these technologies as essentially representing some weird, societal desire to eradicate ""abnormality"" that they think is ""no big deal"".  and i think that attitude is bad and should be discouraged.  tl;dr version: we shouldn't force people who are hearing-impaired to have hearing aids, and we shouldn't talk about them as if they are damaged, but hearing-impaired people should not demonize those amongst them who wish to have hearing aids, nor should they force deafness on others in order to perpetuate their personal identities.",1,,0
747417,"your ability to comprehend the english language is flawed. if your critical analysis skills were more advanced, you'd realise that i didn't give a ""definition"" of ""personhood"", i gave a number of possible criteria that might be used in the formulation of such a definition.  also, if you think that ""disabled people"" are uniformly incapable of abstract thought and empathy, then you have a fairly fucked up view of disability.  as for your other pseudo-point, i find it perfectly arguable that individuals suffering from very severe mental illness are not people. why wouldn't this be the case? i'm not sure that's it's necessarily true, seeing as i don't have a complete and unambiguous definition of personhood, but it's certainly not so self-evidently untrue that merely trotting out the example constitutes an argument against my position. i'd be hesitant to draw a line somewhere, but at the extremes, it's pretty obvious that somone suffering from mild depression continues to be a person, while someone suffering from a persistant and unreversible vegetative state does not.",1,,1

included in regular school it should be part of a series of conversations that you have from now on. keeping an open line between you guys is really important so he knows he can come to you when (or if) he has pain or trouble keeping up or if he gets bullied or if adults fail to act appropriately and mistreat him.  one thing my parents did was they always used real words like cerebral palsy, disabled, [name of specific] therapy, orthotist, and others. they didn't sugar coat or use euphemisms, like differently abled or special needs.  on therapy days my parents would ask how therapy was with mr. b just like they would ask how art or music was with those teachers on those days. it's important your son knows other kids have pull-outs for special services. some kids need pt, ot, speech or time with the school psychologist or school nurse or extra help reading or doing math. if he's the only one getting push-in services i'd be caution against it, it can make your son feel even more different and it can lead to other kids bullying him because (in their eyes) he gets more attention. also, pt during gym class is a big fat fuck no. pt can make a person feel very vulnerable and shouldn't be on display. pull-out group therapy can be really fun for some people though.  as an adult i am just now realizing my dad was very good about letting me tell people what i wanted to about my disability. including, if i wanted to, telling super rude people i was contagious and fake coughing and he'd let me (obviously, covid has robbed your son of this joy and i can't recommend doing this now,) but it's important your son knows he doesn't owe anyone his personal private medical history. this includes teachers, students and strangers. it is his decision. almost always. obviously, if he has a playdate or a sleepover away from home a parent might need a little more information but they still don't need much more than he maybe he needs a spotter on the stairs or a reminder to walk slowly or a hand climbing in a truck (or whatever his specific needs are.)  it's important your son knows he and his needs are not an inconvenience and that there is nothing wrong with him. he's different because of his disability but we're all different. some kids need glasses or hearing aids, some kids use asl or read braille. some kids have limb differences, some use wheelchairs or wear smos. those are differences are ones you can see but some kids have diabetes and have devices under their clothes to keep them healthy, some kids have allergies and need to be careful of what they eat or carry special medicine. other kids need extra help to do their best in certain subjects or need to take medicine to help them focus their attention on important things. we all have our own things and we all have needs that need to be met in different ways.  it's okay if his muscles are less strong because he has hypotonia. it's just the way it is. not everyone is good at or can do everything (regardless of disability) but with the right supervision, guidance and accommodations your son can try everything to find what he's good at and what he loves. it's important not to lie or mislead your son here.  my parents made it very clear i was expected to do everything i was capable of to the best of my abilities. from chores to dressing myself etc. obviously, if i truly needed help i got it and a lot of accommodations and modifications were neccessary for me to do chores in the beginning but if i tried to play something up i got, ""are your legs broken?"" or ""your legs aren't broken.""  as for the doctor stuff 5 seems like a good time for him to get in the habit of participating in his medical care like talking to the adults and having them speak directly to him in an age appropriate way. he's always going to have cp so he should start learning how to manage it. by the time i was 4 my doctors were talking to me like a real person (and i get exactly what you mean and i don't take offense to your phrasing,) by 10 i was starting to take responsibility for my physical therapy. as a teenager i made my own dentist appointments and pediatrician appointments.  as for the best time to start that would be now. don't force it and don't overwhelm him. these are all things to talk about at different times. some before kindergarten and some later.   you know your kid best and how best to talk to him. just do it a little at a time. you can bring thing up naturally as you might see someone use a wheelchair or wear glasses and you can relate it to his smos. or you can mention something when he stumbles (is cerebral palsy tripping you up?) or you can ask him what he thinks or feels. do you guys do nightly pt or daily speech work at home? those are great times to start talking about it.  the paralympics this summer are a great time to talk about disability and difference. does anyone in your family like to watch sports on tv now? there was so much online to watch on youtube for the paralympics in 2012 i assume there will be the same coverage if not more for tokyo 202one.  i hope this helps.",1,,2
908990,"&gt; they use a local anesthetic.  last i heard, the majority performed in the usa *today* do not use anesthetic. provide me with a reputable reference and i'll change my mind.   but this issue is moot; **we currently have no reliable means of blocking the pain during circumcision**. the best we can do is decrease it slightly.   the following is from a letter to rosemary romberg, author of *circumcision: the painful dilemma*, from a man in florida, circumcised at age 25 under local anesthesia, describing what he felt when the doctor cut his frenulum:  &gt;&gt; ""**they told me there would be no pain ... a tremendous flash of blinding white pain surged through my entire body** ... i thought i had been electrocuted and was dead ... the pain was the worse i have ever experienced ... i cannot imagine any pain possibly being worse.""   the only way to block the pain is to put the patient under general anesthesia (put them to sleep). this is not done on babies because it tends to kill them.   [ramos and boyle observed an incidence of ptsd of almost 70% among boys subjected to ritual circumcision, and **51% among boys subjected to medical circumcision (with local anaesthetic)**.](http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/boyle6/)  you might also be interested in this article: *[""comparison of ring block, dorsal penile, nerve block, and topical anesthesia for neonatal circumcision""](http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/lander/)*  &gt; comparing male circumcisions to female ones is another dishonesty - for female circumcisions they remove the clitoris entirely which is not the same thing unless you ignore biology entirely.  oh please. check out the [list of unique tissue lost in male genital mutilation](http://www.norm-socal.org/lost.html). if you are impatient, here's a [condensed comparison of fgm and mgm](http://www.circumstitions.com/fgmvsmgm.html)   &gt; another outright lie is the claim that being clipped somehow makes you less or more sensitive, depending on what whinefest the person is trying to get you to swallow.  [let's hear what men circumcised as adults have to say:](http://www.circumcision.org/adults.htm)  &gt;&gt; * the greatest disadvantage of circumcision is the awful loss of sensitivity when the foreskin is removed. . . . on a scale of 10, the intact penis experiences pleasure that is at least 11 or 12; the circumcised penis is lucky to get to 3.  &gt;&gt; * the sexual differences between a circumcised and uncircumcised penis is . . . like wearing a condom or wearing a glove. . . . sight without color would be a good analogy. . . . only being able to see in black and white, for example, rather than seeing in full color would be like experiencing an orgasm with a foreskin and without. there are feelings you‚Äôll just never have without a foreskin.  &gt;&gt; * after the circumcision there was a major change. it was like night and day. i lost most sensation. i would give anything to get the feeling back. i would give my house. [this man‚Äôs physician persuaded him to be circumcised by warning he could otherwise get penile cancer. when the man complained of the result, the physician replied, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs normal‚Äù and would not help him.]  &gt;&gt; * i play guitar and my fingers get callused from playing. that‚Äôs similar to what happened to my penis after circumcision.  &gt;&gt; * slowly the area lost its sensitivity, and as it did, i realized i had lost something rather vital. stimuli that had previously aroused ecstasy had relatively little effect. . . . circumcision destroys a very joyful aspect of the human experience for males and females.  the above doesn't sound like a whine-fest to me, it sounds like honest men who regret having a part of their body medically amputated.   and loss of sensitivity makes sense... because **the original and persistent intention of circumcision, male and female, is to decrease sexual pleasure.** duh. that's why they do it. [all the other reasons are lies. for example:](http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/miller1/)  &gt;&gt; circumcision was promoted as a remedy for alcoholism, epilepsy, asthma, gout, rheumatism, curvature of the spine, and headache;173 hysteria and other nervous disorders, paralysis, malnutrition, night terrors, and clubfoot;174 eczema, convulsions, and mental retardation;175 promiscuity, syphilis, and cancer.176 physicians also advised circumcision for the treatment of neurasthenia, a generalized condition characterized by ""morbid fears, fear of society, of solitude, or traveling, of places, of disease, or morbid impulses, to kill one's self or others, mental depression, wakefulness, headache, impaired memory, [or] deficient mental control.  yesterday it was utis. today it's stds and ""cleanliness"". yeah, whatever...  &gt; do your own research in to it.  i've done it. you, on the other hand, have obviously not.  &gt; don't believe anyone else's conclusions but your own, dismiss the conclusions of others outright. think for your fucking self.  i've done that too. you, on the other hand, have obviously not.",1,,0

781131,"some people don't like the term ""wheelchair bound,"" and might say ""uses a wheelchair"" instead.  his diagnosis (what's wrong with him, the reason he uses a chair) will depend on how severe you want his disability to be.  muscular dystrophy is degenerative, meaning he will get worse, losing function until he dies (probably at a young age).  cerebral palsy is probably the handiest, because it encompasses a huge range of disabilities, and isn't degenerative.  someone with cp might be able to walk and do most things, another might be a nearly locked-in quadriplegic.  spinal cord or traumatic brain injuries are similar, but would fit better if you want the disability to start at a certain point, rather than being with him from birth.  i generally only see als and ms in older people.  so basically, cerebral palsy if you want him to have it from birth, and *possibly* have some visible deformity/spasticity in part of his body.  spinal cord injury if you want it to happen after birth, and want him to ""look normal"" other than not having control of part of his body.  the families that i see are usually very caring and protective of their children, to the point that they can be tough to handle.  they are used to fighting with schools, teachers, insurance companies, etc., so they tend to be ready to fight for their kids at any moment.  ""handicapped"" isn't used much.  people might say ""disabled,"" but people who work in the field use ""people first"" language, so they say, ""a person with a disability"" or ""a person who uses a wheelchair.""  if he isn't too severely disabled, he could us a manual wheelchair, meaning he probably has enough strength and coordination in his upper body to push the wheels himself.  if this is the case, his life probably isn't that much different from an average kid.  he would play with toys and video games, go to school, read, write, etc. normally.  transporting him might be a little different, though kids are easier, and his parents might just pick him up and move him around when needed.  he might also need help with the bathroom, or use a small (hand held) urinal to pee.  if he has more severe disabilities, he might use a power wheelchair.  he would use a joystick if possible, or if not, something a head array, sip and puff, switches, etc.  (i can get more into that stuff if you really want to go that route, but it's complicated.)  that means that he wouldn't have good use of his hands/arms, and everything would be harder: using a computer, playing, doing school work, etc.  power wheelchairs are also very heavy, and would require a special van or something to get him around, with every location made accessible with ramps, etc.  honestly, it would be easiest to say that he has mild cerebral palsy or a low (lumbar) spinal cord injury, uses a manual wheelchair, and has good strength/dexterity in his hand and arms.  then he's almost a ""normal"" kid as far as the story goes, except that he happens to roll around in a chair.",1,,0

has ground access, and railings in the halls/bathtub/toilet.  * my children had iep's(can also be used for adult aka over 19 yrs old education), foster respite(overnight disability respite), counselling(disability, marriage breakup, their father being abusive to me and his prior criminal record.  also my son got raped at 4 by another disabled child.)    * my children had adaptive equipment.  my daughter had a walker and wheelchair, my son splints for his legs and things to help him with writing.  both had educational aids though my daughter got hers only after cancer.  my daughter also got cancer camp funding.  language funding was offered by variety club and one other.  my son also had a child care worker that took him out once a week to help with social skills.  the government also covered transportation costs of handydart to special education preschool where he got occupational, speech, and physiotherapy.(they used to pay $180/mo)  * i've been helped with counselling, educational funding, funding for adaptive equipment, and other coverages.  they helped me get a walker but now i'm looking at back and neck braces again.  possibly a wheelchair in time.  i was helped with moving expenses and live in disabled housing.  * some programs were funded on child's iq alone.  they need an 80 iq or less.  some things require physical dependence due to physical limitations of the child.  others simply require an autism diagnosis while others need neurologist, psychologist, geneticist or other specialist reports.    * when i say programs i don't just mean

164428,"experiencing the other i mean this point would mean that a disabled character is  inconvenienced/hindered/disabled by their disability right? otherwise what are we experiencing? if the wheelchair using pc navigates the dungeon just as well as their able-bodied companions then they aren't experiencing the lived experience of real life paraplegics right? at least, that's what i believe, but that gets into the difficulties of ""how do we represent disabilities mechanically in a respectful way"" and thats real gdang difficult because every disabled person has a different lived experience.  but i believe inorder to *experience* even a fraction of what disabled people live everyday in our ttrpgs disabilities must have mechanical relevance.  if not then what? the dm stops description every couple sentences to say that the disabled character/s struggling to traverse the dungeon.  but how do we do that? i think its fair to say that even at a glance some disabilities have immediate benefits in a dnd-sense a couple of examples:  blindness: immunity to a medusas petrifying gaze, immunity to sight-based illusions, some sort of blindsight/tremorsense deafness: immunity to noise based enchantments like command, immunity to thunder damage, sign language as a secret language.  but there are so many disabilities which are difficult to assign benefits to: what inherent benefits does using a wheelchair bring with it? in my eyes anything that could affect an able-bodied person has the same effect on a wheelchair-user. these are just some of the most obvious examples. but if you really think about it it gets really difficult to make sensible positives/negatives to go along with disabilities even more so if we're trying to do it in a respectful way.  exceptional pcs  i think that something that's gotten lost in the *ability* of player characters is that they aren't ""regular people"" like the ones playing them. which i think has led a lot of the current disability rep. movement (see mustangsarts combat wheelchair) because it assumes that since jeremy the regular chubby guy can play his self-insert paladin and do all sorts of heroic feats that he himself would be incapable of then surely ""anyone can be an adventurer"" i think that this logic is flawed, jeremy's paladin isn't jeremy in fantasy armor, i believe that every player character has the capability of a fire fighter! not the average guy, they can sprint for hours in heavy equipment, climb hand-over-hand on a rope (how many people can actually claim the same?) even frail wizards are given a fair shot are climbing a rope, chubby jeremy cant do the same.  this is why i think the ""everyone can be an adventurer"" is kinda weird to me, because if a fire fighter lost their sight, hearing, or the use of their legs, they would no longer be going into burning buildings. theres also a reason that we don't see disabled people *becoming* fire fighters because going into a burning building is already a hazardous situation having someone with you who isn't 100% able-bodied is an even greater hazard.  an example, if burning debris falls from the roof an able bodied fire fighter has a reasonable chance to dodge it, where as a blind or deaf or wheelchair-using fire fighter might not have the senses to notice it in time, or the maneuverability to get out of the way.  ttrpg's are for everyone how we represent everyone is where it gets tricky.",1,,0

674838,"read the article i posted in the first comment for a lot more detail on this but yes - the disability community does greatly prefer the word disability over special needs. there's a study i posted within the article that explains why special needs it an ineffective euphemism (it actually worsens the perception of someone). but the main reason i hate it personally is that i actually don't have special needs. that's framing an abled person as the ""default"" and looking at my needs compared to them which would be similar to referring to a white person as unblack or a straight person as non-lgbt. there is no default option with people - they're all unique. around 25% of adults have at least one disability making us the largest diversity group and having a disability is extremely common. there are plenty of ways different humans have different needs and it doesn't always revolve around disability. for example, as a redhead, i need to stay out of the sun or use extra sunscreen and i need more lidocaine at the dentist. people who are born into generational poverty need to learn to be resourceful and get by with less. those who are taller than average need to learn what homes/cars will work for them to avoid hitting their heads all the time. etc. the needs that people with disabilities have aren't really ""special"" either - they're the same human needs we all have, with a bit of that diversity mixed in. for example, if someone needs to use  a feeding tube rather than eating by mouth because of their disability, their need for nutrition isn't special. we all need food. if someone needs a wheelchair or crutches to get around rather than walking without a mobility aid like most people can, their need for ambulation isn't special. we all need to get to doctor's appointments and shopping and events etc. within our community. we all need teachers to make learning accessible for us, doctors to follow our medical treatment etc. yes disabled people sometimes need more help in certain areas but so do nondisabled people. some nondisabled children walk at 8 months, others don't walk until 20 months and all are normal. there's a wide range of human experience. my youngest daughter is almost 30 months and she can't walk yet because of her disability  - that's not within the range of normal but she takes longer to learn because or her disability and she will learn one day, with the help of pt and mobility aids and eventually on her own and that's okay too. and she can knee walk and crawl which are both valid forms of locomotion too and don't make her any less of a person. or if her disability was different and she couldn't learn to walk and she needed help to be moved or a wheelchair so she could move about using her hands, that would be okay too. her need to get from here to there isn't special - we all need that. and your kiddos with neurodivergence (adhd or autism) doesn't have a ""special"" need to learn and communicate with people around them either. we all need that. so providing them with the help that they need to learn just like all people get the help they need to learn isn't special, it should be par for the course. it's actually a form of ableism, at least in my book, to define the needs of disabled people as ""special"" when the world is set up to make sure abled people's needs are met. in other words, curb cuts for wheelchairs isn't a ""special"" need because the sidewalks are build for abled people. if we started with disabled people and viewed able as different we'd be saying that not having curb cuts is the ""special"" need. whose need is different is all in our perspective. to take an example from the recent covid crisis, just look at the fact that disabled people have been asking to telecommute and work from home as an accommodation for years (for me it makes all the difference because i can sit in a recliner and type to work part time in certain specific types of jobs if i pace myself and take bad days off but i cannot commute to work and sit upright in an office chair, even for a few hours). yet we were told it was not possible to offer work from home in most cases. now suddenly when there's a virus threatening everyone and abled people need to work from home, it's no big deal to shift the way we do things and allow everyone that chance. how frustrating to those of us who have been  blocked from the working world simply because of the lack of accessible jobs. it sounds like your youngest is 2e which is the same as my oldest - the term is ""twice exceptional"" meaning gifted and has a disability. my oldest gets bored very easily because of his giftedness and he needs to learn in certain ways because of his adhd. he is extremely successful because he copes well with his disability not because it doesn't impact him. that's a pretty common myth. perhaps better than mild disability would be to say that his disability has a mild impact on him, because of how hard he works. i don't cope as well with my disability - it impacts me daily and makes it hard to do many things. there are accommodations for adhd such as a quiet space to learn whereas there's no accommodation for my blood pressure being too low and me feeling completely fatigued because of that or my whole body being in pain. but yes, you're right - disabilities do often come with advantages as well. imagine calling helen keller or fdr or andrea bocelli or chris burke or stephen hawkins etc. ""special needs."" helen keller was such a great speaker perhaps in part because before she was 6 she was denied that right because of her disability and she obviously had a lot to say - she just needed a teacher who could find a way to communicate with her even though she was deaf and blind. as i said in my article, people who are agoraphobic don't use much gas. people with chronic illnesses don't need as many clothes because we tend to wear sweats and stretchy leggings most of the time. those with feeding tubes don't need paper plates and picnic tablecloths. there are many ways disabled people use less resources or have less needs as well. so those are some of the reasons why disabled is preferred to ""special"" needs. imo we all have the same human needs, although we sometimes get our needs met differently when we have a disability.",1,,2
467853,"people with disabilities in general aren't represented in any kind of media fairly, whether it's media aimed at children or adults. and when we are represented, it's often in pedantic or infantalizing roles - able-splaining - nondisabled people trying to explain what it's like living with disabilities or inspiration po rn - people without disabilities looking at disabled folks who accomplish something and saying ""aww"" or using it to motivate themselves. if jim with no legs can run a marathon then why can't you get off the couch? that kind of bs. people with disabilities don't want to be portrayed in that way. we'd rather just be just regular characters on shows - normal, complex people who happen to be deaf or have adhd or use a wheelchair to get around.   in fact the term ""special needs"" and how we talk about children with disabilities itself is problematic. we would never call our uncle ""high blood pressure fred"" or our aunt ""endometriosis annie"" or say they have special needs, are special, handicapable, brave warriors and all that other bs. adults with disabilities like myself prefer the term disabled. ""special needs"" is an ineffective euphemism, made up by parents of disabled kids to soften the blow of the word disabled. but disabled people don't have special needs - they need the same things we all do which is food, shelter, medical care, parents that love them, people in the community to support and encourage them etc. people with disabilities might access these needs differently - like a person who uses a feeding tube for nutrition rather than eating food by mouth, but the need is still the same and there's nothing ""special"" about having a disability. so -  sorry for my rant lol but you seem open to being educated on the topic and the sooner we spread the word on the topic, the sooner the world can be a friendlier and more inclusive place for people with disabilities.

638794,"teachers have held up helen keller, the blind and deaf girl who overcame her physical handicaps, as an inspiration to generations of schoolchildren. every fifth grader knows the scene in which anne sullivan spells water into young helen‚Äôs hand at the pump. at least a dozen movies and filmstrips have been made on keller‚Äôs life. each yields its version of the same clich√©. a mcgraw-hill educational film concludes: ‚Äúthe gift of helen keller and anne sullivan to the world is to constantly remind us of the wonder of the world around us and how much we owe those who taught us what it means, for there is no person that is unworthy or incapable of being helped, and the greatest service any person can make us is to help another reach true potential.‚Äù  to draw such a bland maxim from the life of helen keller, historians and filmmakers have disregarded her actual biography and left out the lessons she specifically asked us to learn from it. keller, who struggled so valiantly to learn to speak, has been made mute by history. the result is that we really don‚Äôt know much about her.  over the past twenty years, i have asked hundreds of college students who helen keller was and what she did. all know that she was a blind and deaf girl. most remember that she was befriended by a teacher, anne sullivan, and learned to read and write and even to speak. some can recall rather minute details of keller‚Äôs early life: that she lived in alabama, that she was unruly and without manners before sullivan came along, and so forth. a few know that keller graduated from college. but about what happened next, about the whole of her adult life, they are ignorant. a few students venture that keller became a ‚Äúpublic figure‚Äù or a ‚Äúhumanitarian,‚Äù perhaps on behalf of the blind or deaf. ‚Äúshe wrote, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù or ‚Äúshe spoke‚Äù‚Äîconjectures without content. keller, who was born in 1880, graduated from radcliffe in 1904 and died in 1968. to ignore the 64 years of her adult life or to encapsulate them with the single word humanitarian is to lie by omission.  the truth is that helen keller was a radical socialist. she joined the socialist party of massachusetts in 1909. she had become a social radical even before she graduated from radcliffe, and not, she emphasized, because of any teachings available there. after the russian revolution, she sang the praises of the new communist nation: ‚Äúin the east a new star is risen! with pain and anguish the old order has given birth to the new, and behold in the east a man-child is born! onward, comrades, all together! onward to the campfires of russia! onward to the coming dawn!‚Äù  keller hung a red flag over the desk in her study. gradually she moved to the left of the socialist party and became a wobbly, a member of the industrial workers of the world (iww), the syndicalist union persecuted by woodrow wilson.  keller‚Äôs commitment to socialism stemmed from her experience as a disabled person and from her sympathy for others with handicaps. she began by working to simplify the alphabet for the blind, but soon came to realize that to deal solely with blindness was to treat symptom, not cause. through research she learned that blindness was not distributed randomly throughout the population but was concentrated in the lower class. men who were poor might be blinded in industrial accidents or by inadequate medical care; poor women who became prostitutes faced the additional danger of syphilitic blindness. thus keller learned how the social class system controls people‚Äôs opportunities in life, sometimes determining even whether they can see. keller‚Äôs research was not just book learning: ‚Äúi have visited sweatshops, factories, crowded slums. if i could not see it, i could smell it.‚Äù  at the time keller became a socialist, she was one of the most famous women on the planet. she soon became the most notorious. her conversion to socialism caused a new storm of publicity‚Äîthis time outraged. newspapers that had extolled her courage and intelligence now emphasized her handicap. columnists charged that she had no independent sensory input and was in thrall to those who fed her information. typical was the editor of the brooklyn eagle, who wrote that keller‚Äôs ‚Äúmistakes spring out of the manifest limitations of her development.‚Äù  keller recalled having met this editor: ‚Äúat that time the compliments he paid me were so generous that i blush to remember them. but now that i have come out for socialism he reminds me and the public that i am blind and deaf and especially liable to error. i must have shrunk in intelligence during the years since i met him.‚Äù she went on, ‚Äúoh, ridiculous brooklyn eagle!

122118,"reminds me of this bit by carlin:  tl;dr:  [audio](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnk_kzqcclo&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player)    you can't be afraid of words that speak the truth. i don't like words that hide the truth. i don't like words that conceal reality. i don't like euphemisms or euphemistic language. and american english is loaded with euphemisms. because americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality. americans have trouble facing the truth. so they invent a kind of a soft language to protect themselves from it. and it gets worse with every generation. for some reason it just keeps getting worse.  i'll give you an example of that. there's a condition in combat. most people know about it. it's when a fighting person's nervous system has been stressed to it's absolute peak and maximum, can't take any more input. the nervous system has either snapped or is about to snap. in the first world war that condition was called shell shock. simple, honest, direct language. two syllables. shell shock. almost sounds like the guns themselves. that was 70 years ago. then a whole generation went by. and the second world war came along and the very same combat condition was called battle fatigue. four syllables now. takes a little longer to say. doesn't seem to be as hard to say. fatigue is a nicer word that shock. shell shock ...battle fatigue. then we had the war in korea in 1950. madison avenue was riding high by that time. and the very same combat condition was called operational exhaustion. hey we're up to 8 syllables now! and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase now. it's totally sterile now. operational exhaustion: sounds like something that might happen to your car. then of course came the war in vietnam, which has only been over for about 16 or 17 years. and thanks to the lies and deceit surrounding that war, i guess it's no surprise that the very same condition was called post-traumatic stress disorder. still 8 syllables, but we've added a hyphen. and the pain is completely buried under jargon. post-traumatic stress disorder. i bet you, if we'd still been calling it shell shock, some of those vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time. i bet you that. but it didn't happen. and one of the reasons is because we were using that soft language, that language that takes out the life outta life. and it is a function of time it does keep getting worse.  give you another example. sometime during my life toilet paper became bathroom tissue. i wasn't notified of this. no one asked me if i agreed with it. it just happened. toilet paper became bathroom tissue. sneakers became running shoes. false teeth became dental appliances. medicine became medication. information became directory assistance. the dump became the land fill. car crashes became automobile accidents. partly cloudy became partly sunny. motels became motor lodges. house trailers became mobile homes. used cars became previously owned transportation. room service became guest room dining. constipation became occasional irregularity. when i was a little kid if i got sick they wanted me to go to a hospital and see the doctor. now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization. or a wellness center to consult a health care delivery professional! poor people used to live in slums. now the economically disadvantaged occupy sub-standard housing in the inner cities. and they're broke! they're broke. they don't have a negative cash flow position. they're fuckin' broke! because a lot of them were fired. you know, fired. management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area. so many people are no longer viable members of the work force.  smug, greedy well fed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins. it's as simple as that. the cia doesn't kill people anymore, they neutralize people or they depopulate the area. the government doesn't lie, it engages in disinformation. the pentagon actually measures radiation in some thing they call sunshine units. israeli murderers are called commandos. arab commandos are called terrorists. contra killers are called freedom fighters. well if crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire what do freedom fighters fight? they never mention that part of it to us, do they.  and some of this stuff is just silly. we know that. like when the airlines tell us to pre-board. what the hell is pre-board? what does that mean? to get on before you get on? they say they're going to pre-board those passengers in need of special assistance ... cripples! simple honest direct language. there's no shame attached to the word cripple i can find in any dictionary. in fact it's a word used in bible translations. ""jesus healed the cripples."" doesn't take seven words to describe that condition. but we don't have cripples in this country anymore. we have: the physically challenged. is that a grotesque enough evasion for you? how about differently abled? i've heard them called that. differently abled! you can't even call these people handicapped anymore. they say: ""we're not handicapped, we're handy capable!"" these poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition somehow you'll change the condition. well hey cousin ... [macht ein furzger√§usch] ... doesn't happen! we have no more deaf people in this country. hearing impaired. no more blind people. partially sighted or visually impaired. no more stupid people, everyone has a learning disorder. or he's minimally exceptional. how would you like to told that about your child. he's minimally exceptional. psychologists have actually started calling ugly people those with severe appearance deficits. it's getting so bad that any day now i expect to hear a rape victim referred to as an unwilling sperm recipient!  and we have no more old people in this country. no more old people. we shipped them all away and we brought in these senior citizens. isn't that a typically american twentieth century phrase? bloodless. lifeless. no pulse in one of them. a senior citizen. but i've accepted that one. i've come to terms with it. i know it's here to stay. we'll never get rid of it. but the one i do resist. the one i keep resisting, is when they look at an old guy and say, ""look at him dan, he's ninety years young."" imagine the fear of aging that reveals. to not even be able to use the word old to describe someone. to have to use an antonym. and fear of aging is natural. it's universal, isn't it? we all have that. no one wants to get old. no one wants to die. but we do. so we con ourselves. i started conning myself when i got in my forties. i'd look in the mirror and say, ""well...i guess i'm getting ...older."" older sounds a little better than old, doesn't it? sounds like it might even last a little longer. i'm getting old. and it's okay. because thanks to our fear of death in this country i won't have to die. i'll pass away. or i'll expire, like a magazine subscription. if it happens in the hospital they'll call it a terminal episode. the insurance company will refer to it as negative patient care outcome. and if it's the result of malpractice they'll say it was a therapeutic misadventure.  i'm telling ya, some of this language makes me want to vomit. well, maybe not vomit ... ... makes me want to engage in an involuntary personal protein spill.",1,,2

368956,"&gt; nobody here wants the government to force eugenics.  i assume not, but it's sad that when someone actually exercises her right to not use eugenics she gets lambasted as a ""selfish cunt"".  &gt; you could easily avoid an *obvious* disability  but that's why i asked who decides what a disability is. because it's actually *not* obvious that being deaf or lacking another sense makes someone ""disabled"".  of course the deaf are objectively lacking a sense. but think of color blindness for a moment. while not as extreme as deafness, they do have an objective lack of sense. would people say they are ""disabled""? no.  but they have been ""disabled"" from their ability to see color properly! they objectively lack a sense! the only reason we don't consider them disabled is because we see them living ""normal"" lives. we've carved out an exception for them, or drawn the line at an arbitrary point on the scale of ""lacking senses"" to consider them ""normal"".  well, regardless of what we think, the deaf consider themselves to be able-bodied and living normal lives, too. they may be lacking a sense, but to them that does not mean disablement. hell, they even [enjoy music](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-27/feeling-the-beat-what-it-is-like-to-be-a-deaf-music-fan/7445408).  as the irish deaf society puts it:  &gt; irish sign language is the indigenous language of the deaf community and research shows that sign languages are full languages with its own complex linguistic structure  &gt; [...]  &gt; the deaf community sees itself as a linguistic and cultural minority group as opposed to being disabled.  they don't live anguished or sad lives. they don't feel limited. they are able to get along in life quite well. they don't feel disabled. who are we to tell them they are wrong about their own lives?  &gt; the medical benefits are outstanding, inherited disorders might be a thing of the past  true, and i'm not 100% opposed to all gene editing. but like i've been saying, the gay and deaf communities both share similar concerns when it comes to eugenics. and these concerns don't stop there.  my dad is a ginger. he passed his weak, lily-white skin onto me. i don't live in ireland, where my skin would be adapted to the cloudy conditions. instead, i have some probably cancerous moles that i will talk to my doctor about removing. many people in my family have gotten skin cancer. will our genotype get edited out of existence by eugenics? after all, there are objective criteria for claiming that ginger-ness is a deficiency or health risk.  will ginger mothers someday receive the pitchfork mob calling them ""selfish cunts"" for daring to pass their genes along? i find these attitudes unsettling and abhorrent.  we tend to think of the eugenics debate as theoretical or sci-fi. i think people have a sense of complacency that they're not really issues we have to worry about right now, since it's far off in ""the future"". but the reality is, eugenics have come and we are starting to deal with it *right now*. by the looks of these test runs, i'm not confident at all that society will go down the right path regarding eugenics.",1,,1
219274,"not quite accurate. my initial opinion was based off of earlier this week. it looks like it's been clarified since then.   https://www.nraila.org/articles/20160429/social-security-administration-releases-proposed-rulemaking-on-disability-related-gun-ban   ""ssa‚Äôs intentions have now been made public. as outlined in the proposal, ssa would use five factors to determine which of its disability insurance or ssi recipients have been ‚Äúadjudicated‚Äù by the agency as ‚Äúmental defectives.‚Äù   the first factor is whether the individual filed his or her claim with ssa based on disability. thus, merely receiving retirement benefits from ssa would not trigger further action.  the second factor would require the agency to determine which individuals have ‚Äúbeen found disabled based on a finding that the individual‚Äôs impairment(s) meets or medically equals the requirements of one of the mental disorders listing of impairments‚Äù set forth in ssa rules. **those disorders cover a broad range of conditions, including but not limited to organic mental disorders, intellectual disabilities, anxiety-related disorders,** personality disorders, substance addiction, and autism and other developmental disorders. symptoms of these disorders can range from outright incoherence or hallucination to milder presentations such as sleep or appetite disturbances, decreased energy, or even ‚Äúinflated self-esteem.‚Äù  the third factor is whether the individual has ‚Äúa primary diagnosis code in [ssa‚Äôs] records based on a mental impairment.‚Äù according to the proposal, ‚Äúthe primary diagnosis refers to the basic condition that renders an individual disabled‚Äù under relevant ssa rules.  the fourth factor focuses on the individual‚Äôs age, specifically on whether he or she is at least 18 years old but has not yet attained full retirement age.  factor five is whether the agency has determined the beneficiary‚Äôs payments are to be made through a representative payee based on a determination that he or she is incapable of managing them as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition or disease.""  i agree with this conclusion from the same article:  **""overall, while the proposal is not as drastic as many initially feared and is procedurally more narrowly-tailored than the indefensible procedures of the veteran‚Äôs administration (va), it still raises substantial cause for concern.** **far more people are potentially implicated in the ssa regime than in va‚Äôs regime because of the broader reach of ssa‚Äôs programs. the white house itself estimates that some 75,000 each year could be affected, with no upper limit or end in sight. and while ssa‚Äôs procedures at least consider (unlike va‚Äôs) whether the underlying basis of disability is a mental impairment, those impairments cover a range of conditions, from those that might increase a tendency toward aggressive or self-destructive behavior to those that won‚Äôt.**   **indeed, at no point in the actual ‚Äúadjudication‚Äù is the individual‚Äôs propensity for violence a necessary consideration. rather, the question ultimately devolves to whether or not the individual has any sort of mental condition and can responsibly handle money, which is not a fair basis to strip someone of their constitutional rights.** **the procedures established for relief, moreover, lack adequate due process and do not even allow the petitioner the opportunity for an administrative hearing.**   **from beginning to end, in fact, ssa‚Äôs process makes no provision whatsoever for the individual to attend a formal hearing before an adjudicative authority, to put forth their own experts, or to cross-examining adverse witnesses. it only involves anonymous bureaucrats reviewing documents in a government-compiled file.** **that is hardly the process most americans would consider an adjudication, and certainly not one sufficient to strip someone of fundamental liberties**.""",1,,1

779539,"you‚Äôre welcome! sorry i‚Äôm replying a touch late here, busy day yesterday. warning: this will probably be long just because there‚Äôs a lot that goes in to this subject, whoops!   so the fact that b is a young prodigy at the time absolutely will affect their view on themselves and their character as a whole. if the disability caused them to lose the ability to participate in whatever they‚Äôre a prodigy in, that‚Äôs a whole other can of worms. there can be a pretty distinct difference between people who were born disabled or became disabled early in life vs someone who became disabled in adulthood regarding their outlook on their disability. your character is kind of right at that halfway point of being able to remember being able-bodied, but also young enough to where they would be fully adjusted to disability by adulthood. they would have mourned their loss of ability, changes to their lifestyle, possible loss of friends who couldn‚Äôt handle the change, etc. if they lost the ability to do what they loved, it would be even harder on them emotionally. they would also likely have trauma from whatever caused the injury or the hospital stay afterwards so consider whether they were in therapy growing up to work through their issues or if they‚Äôve held on them and never worked through them.   i would recommend doing research on internalized ableism. i assume you‚Äôre able-bodied so you likely have a lot of it you need to work through if you want to avoid misrepresenting your characters (i mean that completely neutrally, we alllll internalize that stuff and even 5 years into being disabled i still have tons of it to work through, so no judgement), and it‚Äôs something your characters will likely deal with to an extent. it can be a big part of the disabled experience so try to at least touch on it.   i bring that subject up because internalized ableism between someone who was disabled growing up vs in adulthood usually look pretty different. for someone who grew up disabled, they likely internalize the views of the adults around them surrounding their disability, and in all honesty parents of disabled children rarely involve themselves or their child in the disabled community, so they may call the child things such as ‚Äúspecial needs‚Äù or ‚Äúdifferently abled‚Äù (phrases that are generally frowned upon), assume their child will be incapable of ever taking care of themselves (leading to learned helplessness in some cases), tell their child that they can and should want to overcome their disability at all costs, even if the child is well-adjusted to being disabled and doesn‚Äôt want to go through hours of grueling physical therapy and cycle through new kinds of drugs all the time just for the slight chance that they may walk again when they‚Äôd rather focus on other things. they‚Äôll internalize these things and usually either believe them or reject them outright. someone disabled in adulthood may have experience with disability which will either cause them to be more accepting of their injury or less, depending on how they view it. i personally already knew of the disabled community before i became disabled and was able to go to them for support, which probably fast tracked my ability to deal with being disabled versus someone who has only ever seen tragic examples of disability, someone who thinks being paralyzed means your life is over because they‚Äôve seen it on tv over and over again, versus a child who may be a little more open and may not have those preconceived views.   as far as how they‚Äôd be physically effected by being disabled so long, i can‚Äôt speak *as* much as someone who isn‚Äôt paralyzed, but that‚Äôll rely on the level of injury and whether it was complete or incomplete, whether they have joint laxity (like floppy limbs) or spasticity (muscles being locked up and often causing random movements), and what kind of medical care they had access to growing up. leg atrophy being more advanced is the only thing i can think of off the top of my head just because i‚Äôm not familiar with long-term outcomes of paralysis. i myself have a character who is a paraplegic so i know more about sci‚Äôs than the average joe but not so much about them in children or in the long term.   a fall would work! even a really tall one could be survivable for a child in the right circumstances. other ways i‚Äôve seen people become paralyzed include gymnastics accidents and accidents in the pool, bmx-ing and other extreme sports, spinal strokes, cauda equina, neurological diseases, botched surgeries, even brain tumors. there‚Äôs tooons of ways to paralyze a character so you can really take your pick of what suits your story best.  as far as things that can cause someone to be able to stand or walk while still needing a wheelchair, all of the above can apply and then some (not everyone who‚Äôs paralyzed is 100% so, so your characters could have the exact same reason for needing a wheelchair but totally different outcomes, with one being completely unable to move or feel while the other is able to recover more function). for some people, their legs and/or spine could be totally fine and it could be an issue with fatigue or pain causing them to use the chair. some people have diseases like multiple sclerosis, where sometimes it flares up and they‚Äôre really bad and other times they don‚Äôt need the chair and can even be functionally able-bodied for those periods. you can google ‚Äúambulatory wheelchair user‚Äù to find out more. you‚Äôll probably mostly find people with eds (ehlers danlos syndrome), a disease that affects the body‚Äôs collagen, or pots (postural orthopedic tachycardia syndrome) which can cause someone to pass out from standing and being upright, just because for some reason those two diseases seem to be having a moment in that area, but there‚Äôs tooooons of stuff outside of those and all the other things i listed.   for myself, walking for longer than 15 minutes almost always causes intense fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, fever, and muscle weakness. so maybe i could go to the grocery store one day using only my cane, but that half hour to an hour at the grocery store will be the only thing i‚Äôll be able to do that day because the only way to stop it is to go lie down and/or sleep for the rest of the day, and the effects can even carry on in to the next day if i push it too hard. in my wheelchair, i can go faster, longer, and more comfortably while still retaining energy and being able to function enough to do more than one task a day. i can keep up with whoever i‚Äôm with instead of being 20 paces behind. i can focus on what i‚Äôm doing instead of just trying to keep myself upright. it can get confusing for people because one day i‚Äôll be in my chair and then the next i‚Äôm walking the 15 mins (i got lucky there because that‚Äôs as far as i can go!) to work with my cane, and then the next i‚Äôm walking around my job completely unassisted. it‚Äôs all contextual‚Äîi can‚Äôt stop and sit down at the grocery store, and i have shit i need to do, so wheelchair. walking is good for me, so i use my cane for the walk to work instead of rolling, but i make sure to stay within my limits. and then at work i sit most of the time and only have a small space to navigate, so i don‚Äôt need the cane at all. this is referred to sometimes as dynamic disability and personally i would love to see more representation in that area.",1,,2

the normal classrooms for general education and the labs are upstairs.  this school has no elevator, because it's an old building. the only school with an elevator is the one focused on languages. so this little girl, who happens to need a wheelchair, can either somehow find transport to a science focused school an hour away, have her whole family move, or she needs to suck it up and go to the language school when she couldn't give less of a rats ass about languages.  my former school was like the science based one in this example. there wasn't another one with these programs within 2 hours.  i live in a country where most buildings are old. that means in some smaller villages and towns, stuff like city hall is under historic protection and sometimes, they only have stairs. getting those altered is a ridiculous fight. my local train station has no elevator. a mobility impaired person needs to stay on the train to the city half an hour away, get on the bus, *if* there's a bus. there are two a day that drive from that city to my village. two. a day. usually you'll have to take a taxi.  my aunt has a mental disability. in my country, that means she doesn't have to be paid minimum wage, because employing her is seen as an act of charity and the state pays for a lot of her expenses anyway.  my aunt. a human being with complex thoughts and emotions. is seen as undeserving of the freaking *minimum wage* a person without cognitive impairment would earn.  during all my schooling, i have not shared a single classroom with a disabled person. people on crutches had to take the stairs with their broken legs.  the hospital i work in - a freaking hospital - has three parking spaces for disabled people right in front of the clinic, and four more a 5 minute walk away. that amounts to a total of seven.  it is the biggest hospital in my closest city, and public transport is shit as we've already established. i had to take my mobility impaired grandma there before her death, and it was such a shitshow.  all our disabled patients have to be driven there, pretty much.  the world is inaccessible for people with disabilities. and that is ableism. people being excluded from the get go because they don't fit the so called ""norm"" of able bodied, mentally unimpaired people.  if you ever want to see it in action, come over and i'll show you around, to the sidewalks that aren't wide enough for wheelchairs, and that are too high to get on, so you'd have to be on the road for 40m before there's a place to get on.   to my school, where you can't get to a gen ed classroom, and where most science labs will be inaccessible to you. where there is a single stall for disabled people, in a school for 700 students. one. stall.  to my aunts workplace, where real people do their best to work and make a living, only to be found less deserving of minimal respect than a non-disabled person.  to my hospital, where i'll stop in the middle of the parking lot, put on my hazards, and help you out of the car in a much too narrow space while people honk at us, before i'll leave you for a bit to find a parking spot, while you just have to chill there by yourself before i can show you around.  that's ableism.   i know you can't walk. i'm a nurse, i work with a shitload of people who can't.  but that doesn't mean you should need a special school for disabled people, so our kids can stay neatly segregated into ""broken and non-broken"" people. the current status quo is disgusting and inhumane, and it treats disabled people as less than, and it makes me so freaking angry that i cry about it sometimes when an uneducated majority votes for the people that keep the status quo.  they don't know about ableism because they never have to think about it. the stairs, the subpar payment, the schools aren't their problem because they're not disabled. they just never have to think about it. and so they vote and it stays the same while i could scream with rage because no one should be forced to move from my beautiful village because they suddenly need a wheelchair and can't use public transport anymore. but my neighbour did that. because our government didn't give a fuck and didn't do anything to make our station accessible.  eta: don't get me started about the wonderful practice of asking people about patients with cognitive disabilities instead of asking the patients. most people who aren't nonverbal will be able to tell you how they are as long as you take the time to listen. their voice sounds unusual and their speech pattern may be, too, but the amount of doctors who don't take the time to ask their own freaking patients about their health and instead ask nurses and next of kin when the patient is fully capable of understanding and answering the question is abhorrent. people with cognitive impairments or even mental illnesses are treated like subhuman in medicine and i can't deal with it.",1,,2

106169,"&gt;the word ""retard,"" however, has always meant a person with a disability.   i disagree with this statement.  you can retard the growth of a plant, or just be tardy to class.  ""retard"" as a description for a person who is mentally disabled developed later on because of the actual meaning of the word ""retard"" or ""retardation.""  &gt;even when someone uses it medically, now, the term ""retarded"" automatically conjures an image of someone incapable, unimportant, and sub-human.  and that's the problem.  it shouldn't be applied to people any more than we should use ""lame"" or ""dumb"" to refer to people with other handicaps, but at this point in the development of our language, i guess i feel like saying something is ""retarded"" isn't that different from saying something is ""lame"" or ""dumb.""  note that i find there to be a specific distinction between this word and the case of the pejorative use of the word ""gay"" (""that's gay"") simply because one group of people is still trying to claim that word for themselves (gay) and the other is not (people with mental disabilities aren't using the word ""retard"" to refer to themselves).  which is largely what makes the difference for me in what the goal of a campaign like this should be.  if you don't want to be called retards, don't tell people that their use of the word ""retarded"" to refer to other stupid stuff offends you.  doing so places some claim on the word as it applies to you.  the better solution is to let ""retarded"" progress into the realm of ""lame"" and ""dumb"" and make a point of disassociating the word from people with mental disabilities.  a campaign to strike out the word from general usage because it offends people with mental disabilities (and their families, etc.) does the exact opposite.  it more closely associates them with the term.  and i realize that my attitude is probably highly colored by the fact that i don't have anyone close to me that suffers from a mental disability and therefore i am somewhat removed from that side of the discussion, but it's just my take on it.  edit -- in re-reading my post, i find myself considering how i would feel if the pejorative that got used was ""fag"" instead of ""gay"" (given that the community doesn't want to lay claim to the former) and i find myself thinking that people saying ""that's faggy"" probably wouldn't go over well with me.  but on a more intellectual level, i think if the word progressed to the point where it was a synonym for ""stupid"" but it *wasn't* used to refer to gay people, that might be different.  i guess i feel like ""retarded"" is on the cusp of doing this in our culture.  i don't know many people who would ever think of calling a mentally disabled person ""retarded"" but they use the word to refer to other things that are stupid.  eh, i don't know, it's a thorny issue.",1,,1

294806,"i think the trick to this (just like in other parts of your life) is to stop thinking of ""how do i make this work like an able-bodied person does it"" and focus more on ""how do i address the challenges i have to make this work the best for me, given both my capabilities and limitations."" the fact is, you can't make this work like everyone else does.  your limitations, and the limitations those limitations create, are very real. but that doesn't mean you can't make it work. the reality is that we all have limitations of some sort - maybe we live with our parents, or we're homeless, or we get off too quickly or can't get off at all, or we have herpes, or vaginismus or ptsd or an embarrassing kink...the list goes on. the trick is not to make let those limitations limit your possibilities, but rather to approach the situation (and to likewise look for a partner who will approach the situation) from the same perspective as an engineer looking at an engineering problem like building a dam in a fault zone or constructing a machine with limited resources: as a fun-oriented puzzle or challenge that requires creating a range of viable, desirable and even beautiful solutions within the framework of those limitations.   you need help getting into bed, so you look for someone who's okay helping you with that, even if it's just helping you maneuver into a lift. anyone who's not okay with at least helping is off the list because it's not fair to either of you to start a long-term relationship where a clear core reality is a no-go zone. for example, someone who's blind probably shouldn't be dating someone who hates guiding someone around or who resents the limitations that blindness imposes on their activities. there's nothing wrong with someone having those feelings - everyone's entitled to their boundaries and personal feelings - but it will make the relationship strained and build resentment as time goes on. so why go that way if you have the option of finding someone who's either okay with it or is even enthusiastic about it? case in point, i love lifting heavy shit - it's fun for me and i get to show off and feel like a sexy bad-ass. if my husband needed me to lift him into bed sex, i'd end up making it part of our foreplay as a natural reflex, because lifting makes me feel hot as fuck (also, woot for lifting-induced testosterone rushes).  you have physical limitations and mobility issues, so you look for someone who's capable of seeing those issues as part of a fun-oriented sex-engineering challenge, rather than as fun-quashing limitations. someone, for example, who sees the chair and thinks, ""okay, what can i do with this...oooo....*sexy thoughts intensify*"" rather than, ""fuck, how am i going to do this?""   you have some biological and physiological issues, so you need someone who likewise can work with those in a positive way rather than seeing them as a negative. for example, a while back the hubster was having some erection issues. instead of feeling like i was missing out on something by focusing on what we couldn't do (hard, solid thrusting for more than a few minutes), we spent time exploring 101 fun things to do with a softie. it went...well. we learned that sucking on softies can be as much fun or even more fun than doing it when they're hard, and it feels just as good to him either way. we also discovered that if i play my cards right, i can get him to climax dry (multiple times, even) without ever getting hard. we learned that once he's in and fully seated, thrusting with a softie creates it's own range of really nice tugging and vacuum-creating sensations. we also spent that time exploring other sex stuff that didn't require a penis, stuff that often actually gets overlooked when both parties are functioning normally and in the rush to get to the main event. both of us now have a much broader skill-set and range of activities for making the other feel good as a result. end result: we have a better, more varied sex life now than we did before the ""problems.""  you're disabled and are likely to remain so your entire life. anyone you are in a relationship has to not only be okay with that, but they need to actively love you for who you are and see you as a whole person as-is (rather than seeing you as *human being: subset - impaired*). this is an important difference, and it will be vital for maintaining a healthy relationship on-goingly. otoh, you want to steer clear of handicap fetishizers (unless you're into that, in which case go for it) or those who will see dating you as a mighty act of karma, a glorious burden, or some other such bullshit that makes it all about them and how good they are. these are parasites and they will require things from you you don't have to give, and then they will hurt you when things don't go the way their mental framework says they should go. these types can be tricky to avoid, and it's tempting to just settle for one because at least it's something. don't. you deserve more, and you're worth more than just being someone else's emotional masturbatory aid.  i will admit, it's not going to be as easy to find interested and interesting women with these traits as it is to find interested and interesting women in general, dating-wise. but it helps to think like a company or a brand and focus on marketing yourself to the target audience you *actually want,* rather than advertising shotgun style to everyone and hoping you get lucky. yes, your pool of potential ""customers"" is smaller and somewhat harder to find. but everyone in it is far more likely to be right for you, from a ""casual sex"" level all the way up to a long term or even lifelong relationship level.  tl;dr - the key mentality here, for you and her: *challenge accepted. bring it on.* focus on that, and on the reality that you deserve to have a happy, fulfilling sex life and personal relationship, even if you have to do it differently than others do. that's the best advice i can give. and i wish you the very best of luck.",0,,

748538,"not to be a buzzkill, but ""handicapped"" as a term has fallen out of favor. handicap has negative connotations because there is no comparable term for an an able-bodied person, and thus implies that people with physical and mental handicaps are not ""normal.""  hence, disabled is the more acceptable term. disability implies that a person has either a physical or mental impediment, but that their disability is a condition, rather than a defining characteristic.   :edit: cool, i'll just leave this hear for you dumb-asses downvoting me.   *put the person first.  say ‚Äúperson with a disability‚Äù rather than ‚Äúdisabled  person.‚Äù say ‚Äúpeople with disabilities‚Äù rather than ‚Äúthe disabled.‚Äù for  specific disabilities, saying ‚Äúperson with tourette syndrome‚Äù or ‚Äúperson who  has cerebral palsy‚Äù is usually a safe bet. still, individuals do have their own  preferences. if you are not sure what words to use, ask.  avoid outdated terms like ‚Äúhandicapped, crippled or retarded.‚Äù be aware  that many people with disabilities dislike jargony, euphemistic terms like  ‚Äúphysically challenged‚Äù and ‚Äúdifferently abled.‚Äù say ‚Äúperson who uses a  wheelchair‚Äù rather than ‚Äúconfined to a wheelchair‚Äù or ‚Äúwheelchair bound.‚Äù  the wheelchair is what enables the person to get around and participate in  society; it‚Äôs liberating, not confining.*  http://www.unitedspinal.org/pdf/disabilityetiquette.pdf   further reading: http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/nr/rdonlyres/fa6906eb-4cb3-4408-8a0e-5c9ed167989b/0/disabilityetiquette.pdf",1,,1

613377,"&gt;yikes. this is just... you do realize that philosophers like aquinas are often criticized for relying too much on reason?   i don't care.   believing in something without evidence....or, as is the case of many god claims, in direct contradiction to evidence, is an act of irrationality.   well, let's look at your blog...   &gt;the basic argument goes something like this. it says that because a person is born a certain way (born with certain characteristics), the choices he makes as a result of being born that way are morally justified.   strawman.   not a good start, is it?   &gt;it says that a human male is aimed at certain ends. and a human male is healthy insofar as he is individually aimed at those ends. so, humans, by their essence, are aimed at seeing. if a particular human is blind, we would call his eyes (and him) defective or disabled because his eyes aren't and he isn't able to do what humans, by their essence, do.    here's a problem with your example....   first of all, i'm going to give you enough credit to assume that you would not call being blind...or, as you are so desperate to separate the action from the thing itself, the act of 'being blind' immoral. if so, why did you even bother to bring it up?   second, blindness is directly detrimental to an organism's chances of survival and quality of life. homosexuality, on the other hand, is totally innocuous.   i also find it odd that your argument appears to be that homosexual acts are immoral because humans should be able to overcome their base templates, and yet you appear to be defining what is 'moral' and 'natural' along a.....wait for it....base template.   &gt;but the parallel is of course completely faulty. brown eyes (and eye color in general) have nothing to do with a human's flourishing, whereas sexual orientation does.   i challenge you to demonstrate that homosexuality has any effect whatsoever on a person's ability to....'flourish'. all current evidence indicates that homosexuals can experience and enjoy life just as much as heterosexual individuals. we can fall in love, we can have families, we can work, we can have hobbies‚Ä¶.there is nothing whatsoever about homosexual that limit‚Äôs an individuals enjoyment of life, beyond your arbitrary and - i believe - extremely archaic notion that a person is only ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô if they‚Äôre popping out offspring.  i have a friend who, along with his wife, has elected not to have any children at all and to instead adopt. he wants to provide a good home to children currently stuck in the revolving door of foster care. but then, if we were to judge him by your extremely narrow criteria, i imagine you would have to conclude that he is being extremely immoral by doing so‚Ä¶.certainly the rich and happy life that he enjoys with his wife and adopted children would not fit your definition of ‚Äòflourishing‚Äô.   &gt;as i noted, human life is defined by two aspects: survival and reproduction. if it's healthy in regards to those two things it's flourishing. if it's not, it's disabled.    uh huh. that doesn't match any definition of 'disabled' i have ever heard, and i would shudder to live in a world in which someone who was not popping out babies was considered 'disabled'.   anyway, i quote you directly when i say:   &gt;or, a better way to put it is that morally relevant actions do not follow from status.   there's a person's status as a human should not make your narrowly defined permanents morally relevant. your argument is contradictory at best.   &gt;similarly, if a man's brain doesn't work in such a way that he can't get erect to have sex with a woman in order to reproduce, we should clearly say that he has a disability.   except science disagrees with you. homosexuality has not been considered a disability for some decades now (in most civilised countries), and study after study has found no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality has any negative impact on a subject's quality of life whatsoever.    &gt;because, as i've noted, sexuality is aimed, by its very essence, at reproduction.     do you then consider recreational sex to be immoral?    &gt; once heard of a man who could only get aroused when looking at fire. he was obsessed with fire. he would burn buildings down to masturbate to the flames. outside of fire, he had serious trouble becoming aroused, and from what i understand, he could not reach climax without a fire. he was eventually arrested for burning down (uninhabited) buildings in a neighborhood to get off.    the plural of ""anecdote"" is ""anecdotes"". not ""convincing argument"".    &gt;this person would clearly count as disabled because he isn't oriented toward the natural good end of human sexuality. and the natural, good end of human sexuality is reproduction and protection of one's young.   again, what you are saying goes against science (i.e. what philosophy isn't). actual experts (which philosophers aren't) had concluded that homosexuality should be included within the normal ranges of human sexuality.    sexual disorders, such as the one from which your fire-loving anecdote, are refered to as paraphilias; homosexuality is not among them.   &gt;what the modern world has done, i think, is replaced this metaphysical, objective sense of flourishing with some vague sense of ""happiness."" a homosexual is ""happier"" when he has sex with other men, so this counts as his sort of flourishing, so he should have sex with other men. **they wouldn't take this to its logical extreme, of course.** they wouldn't say a pedophile is happiest having sex with children, so he should have sex with children.    that is not a logical progression at all. liking the actions of two consenting adults to the actions of a paedophile and a child who is incapable of giving consent is little more than a slippery slope argument. the only way you can join the dots between the two is by hideously (and i suspect deliberately) misrepresenting the argument being put forward in favour of homosexuality.    okay, i'm getting rather fed up reading your blog....suffice to say, i do not find your arguments altogether compelling or thought provoking. i consider them to be at times contradictory, at others at direct odds with what experts in the field have actually determined.   it saddens me greatly that you feel so much shame over what you are that you feel the need to use such owellion double-think to justify try and excuse yourself.    &gt;i'm no scientist   about the only sentence in your entire diatribe that i believe to be accurate.",1,,0

104230,"this is a topic i could talk for hours on....but here is a little bit about language  inclusive language  language is an incredibly powerful tool, and can be used to create a sense of empowerment, pride, identity and purpose. contrary to the old adage ""sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me,"" improper use can have a devastating impact, even with the best intentions.  it can be difficult to keep up with what is the acceptable terminology in relation to disability, so we‚Äôve compiled a brief refresher for you. focus on the person, not the impairment  in australia, best practice language is to use ‚Äúperson with disability‚Äù or ‚Äúpeople with disability‚Äù.  person-first language is the most widely accepted terminology in australia.  examples of person-first language include: ‚Äúperson with disability‚Äù, ‚Äúperson who is deaf‚Äù, or ‚Äúpeople who have low vision‚Äù.   put the person first, and the impairment second (when it‚Äôs relevant). other terms that are growing in popularity and acceptance are ‚Äúperson living with disability‚Äù, and ‚Äúperson with lived experience of disability‚Äù. these terms are inclusive of people who may have experienced disability in the past, but don‚Äôt any longer, and also people who are carers.   we also prefer to say ‚Äúperson without disability‚Äù, and do not recommend the terms ‚Äúnon-disabled‚Äù or ‚Äúable-bodied‚Äù. don‚Äôt use language that implies a person with disability is inspirational simply because they experience disability    people with disability are just living their lives, they are no more super-human than anyone else. implying that a person with disability is courageous or special just for getting through the day is patronising and offensive.   conversely, don‚Äôt make out that people with disability are victims or objects of pity   just because a person experiences disability, it does not make them weak, a victim or someone to be pitied. examples of language that can imply people should be pitied include ‚Äúsuffering from‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äústruck down by‚Ä¶‚Äù, and ‚Äúafflicted by/with‚Ä¶‚Äù. we try to remove the emotion from the language, for example, ‚Äúpaul experiences depression‚Äù, ‚Äúravi developed multiple sclerosis‚Äù, or ‚Äúkatya has epilepsy‚Äù.   people are not ‚Äòbound‚Äô by their wheelchairs   the term wheelchair-bound is one that is commonly used in mainstream media, and it is one that really irritates (and often offends) many people with disability, and anyone with any knowledge of the social model of disability. a person who uses a wheelchair is not bound by the chair; they are enabled and liberated by it, it can become an extension of their body. ‚Äúconfined to a wheelchair‚Äù is equally as negative use ‚Äúwheelchair user‚Äù or ‚Äúperson who uses a wheelchair‚Äù, instead.   ‚Äòdisclosure‚Äô can imply secrets and lies   we are moving away from the traditional terminology of ‚Äòdisclosure of disability‚Äô (in a workplace setting), as it can make it seem like the person is divulging a secret. we avoid ‚Äúdeclaration of disability‚Äù for similar reasons. we also tend to steer clear of the increasingly popular phrase ‚Äúidentify as a person with disability‚Äù, as this brings with it a whole range of other issues around identity and belonging. someone may have impairment, but still not identify as a person with disability. we now tend to use the simple phrase ‚Äúchoose to share information about their disability/impairment‚Äù, when talking about a person‚Äôs choice to let their employer or colleagues know about their disability or specific requirements.   avoid euphemisms and made up words   ‚Äúdifferently abled‚Äù, ‚Äúpeople of all abilities‚Äù, ‚Äúdisability‚Äù, ‚Äúdiffabled‚Äù, ‚Äúspecial needs‚Äù and the like, are all euphemistic and can be considered patronising. while the intention is usually good, these phrases tend to fall into the trap of making people with disability out to be special or inspirational, just for living with disability (see above point).   change the focus from disability, to accessibility   in recent years, our sector have increasingly referred to accessibility action plans or access and inclusion plans, rather than disability action plans. this makes the focus much more inclusive, and incorporates the requirements of a diverse range of people who may have access needs, including older people, parents and carers of young children, and travellers.   similarly, car parks, lifts and bathrooms are now appropriately described as accessible, rather than disabled or handicapped. relax, and don‚Äôt get caught up in semantics   while the above information may seem daunting if it‚Äôs new to you, the most important thing you can remember is to simply focus on the person, rather than the disability. don‚Äôt be so afraid of saying the wrong thing that you don‚Äôt say anything at all. relax, be willing to communicate, and listen.  next lesson...human rights...lol",1,,1

343377,"i'll begin by saying i have a brother who is a very low functioning mentally handicapped man, and i have been involved in the local ucp and special needs schools for the entirety of my life. it seems pretty common to paint ""the disabled"" with a very broad brush when people talk about the special needs and how society should be treating them, what we should expect from them and how their education should be carried out. perhaps obviously, there is a massive spectrum even amongst those with cerebral palsy in regards to what they are capable of. coddling never yields results, but i often find myself frustrated by well-intentioned young people in the field of special education (who i respect so dearly) who nonetheless enter in with ignorant preconceived notions about how to face the education and development of special needs kids and adults. yes, many individuals with down syndrome and autism (which is as much of a spectrum as anything) are capable of holding jobs. some can hold down rather complex jobs. that does not mean that my brother who had the mental capacity of a four year old can act like an adult and participate in the work force to a level that would at all be satisfactory. trust me, it's been years of banging our heads against the wall. while it's important to test them, there are limits of comprehension and capability. in regards to sporting events, i agree that it may be pity to some degree, but i find little harm in it often because most people aren't thinking of it that way directly and i doubt the subject of the ""pity"" often picks up on it amidst the excitement of whatever is happening. and oftentimes, i think that the football team that lets a player with down syndrome score or the school that votes a down syndrome girl to prom queen is often more so an attempt to repay someone who brings joy into their lives and reminds them of fundamental human kindness. that is, at least, how i like to view these things.",1,,0
900365,"of course we have all kinds of exotic niche adaptations for disabled people.  we have the resources to afford it without it compromising mainstream society.  it poses no a appreciable inconvenience most of the time too.   that's why such things exist. it isn't because being humane has actually gotten more important.  humanity is every bit as greedy, cruel, indifferent and opportunistic as ever it was.   and if you do your homework, you'll find that none of the things you listed are provided out of the sheer goodness of our collective hearts.   its a profitable industry to make stuff that caters to the disabled and the different, but only, and i stress *only*, because we've collectively got resources and bandwidth to spare for it.   humane interests are luxury items.  that's just human nature at work.  nobody's modifying cars for dwarfs for free though.   nobody's developing bionic prosthetics because they don't see opportunities for wealth, prestige and glory to win in doing so.  that's the irony about the humane - humanity is not very good at all at actually being 'humane'.   we're very good at telling ourselves ever so clever stories about how humane and altruistic we are, of course, buuuut...   see that annoying thing called the entirety of human history?  see how nobody was expending time or resources on the cripples and the functionally compromised at any point ever where such resources were not in high enough supply to keep mainstream wants and needs and functions satisfied?   see how the crippled, the mentally ill and the malformed were treated for most of human history everywhere and in all known time periods?   that's humanity when it doesn't think it has enough for the normal and the typical.   that's how much humanity at large actually cares about the different and the compromised.   its very easy to appear to be generous when you have far more than you need, if you care to bother with appearing to be generous that is.   modern first world nations have the resources and modern people have the time to devote to even the most fringe of interests though, and some of that has gone to the benefit of the crippled and to mental health and to industrially manufacturing things for people that aren't of normal size or that have extremely curved spines, etcetera, so forth, so on.   if resources become scarce again, you may rest assured that these 'humane' concerns will be amongst the first to be abandoned, however.  money and materials won't be dedicated to edge cases if feeding the mainstream wants gets difficult, nevermind if mainstream needs come under strain.   have you noticed how companies that make things have stopped making a lot of stuff in the past couple of years?   they've consolidated resources and effort into making their core products on a great many industries because resources and labor availability just weren't there to continue making the weird or fun or edge-case products anymore.   they had to cater to the majority that were in the market for their core products.   this is evidence of what i'm saying that's true and effortless to observe in the world around you right now.   i'm not speculating about me this works.  it is going on right now.  has been more and more since covid started up.   if things get bad enough, you can rest assured that resources will continue to be focused on catering to the wants and needs of the average person to the exclusion of that which just isn't useful or necessary to said average person.   this isn't a declaration of how it should be or how it shouldn't be.  this is not a statement of preference.   this is how it is.  this is how humanity works.  and you can hate it until you die of apoplectic fits if that's your pleasure, but human nature doesn't care and won't be changing at your pleasure.   now, to declare my preference.   the functionally normal *should* be catered to, because the strength of the species is consolidated in all ways in the majority.  that's the overwhelming standard.  that's most of humanity.   the crippled and the compromised are not made more useful to serving the needs to society in those states.   the most useful members of society will not be the people born without arms or the people that are deaf or the people that are paralyzed or the people that have mental health issues that require treatment of any kind.   and when society must choose between feeding the able-bodied sound-of-mind person and the blind, legless person, history will repeat and the functionally compromised will be abandoned.  maybe with regrets.  maybe with scorn and abuse.   the sentimentality might vary, but the ruthless calculus of just how 'humane' humanity isn't never does.   so, we should accept the reality of our condition so that we can at least understand it.  pretending it isn't so is just lying to yourself.   that's never going to be a smart thing to do.   if we're going to build a way to get from the bottom floor to the top floor, it should be ideal for the average person.  if we have time and resources to spare to making such things for people that can't walk, that's very nice and we should do that too if we can.  we should always stay aware and prescient of human nature and how we very easily stop caring when it stops being easy so that we can make ourselves look for ways to build ramps that everyone, be they on foot or on wheels, can navigate rather than just stairs.   acknowledging how we are and how that isn't even always insensible is necessary to ever actually being humane.   priority goes to the majority though when survival is on the line.  if we have the time and resources to do only one thing, that one thing should cater to the average person, not some extraordinarily uncommon creature of misfortune that was born without arms.   catering to the typical human will always be ideal, because that's a numbers game.  if you have to choose between something that caters to the majority of something the caters to a minority, it's ruthless calculus time.   if you can do both without making a shitshow of it, by all means, that's great.   if you're demanding that we capsize the majority so that a tiny minority can be catered to, get out of here with that nonsense.    you have the audacity to call me ignorant in the same breath that you admit that you didn't read it though?   do you always shit in your own shoes and cry about how something stinks or is this a special day for you?",1,,-2

525808,"this is a great question, and one that needs a lot more study. disability studies in classics is a growing field, but unfortunately that means it's also one which has been largely neglected until very recently. a 2013 edited volume from a major classical publisher claimed to be 'the first volume ever to systematically study the subject of disabilities in the roman world' - which isn't quite accurate, but gives you an idea of the state of the field.^(1)  in part, the lack of scholarly attention exists because scholars have assumed that disabled people didn't have much of a life expectancy in the ancient world - and while that's a huge oversimplification, it's worth bearing in mind that the sort of injuries that would leave you with a lifelong disability were *much* less survivable in the roman world than they would be today. [as i've written in another answer, the romans knew that even the best surgery carried a good chance of killing the patient rather than curing them](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/hyagji/survivability_of_caesarian_births_by_the_mother/fzc40ck/), and the odds of surviving something traumatic like an amputation would have been less than even.  disability, however, doesn't have to equate to injury, though we do have plenty of accounts of men disabled in war. in one part of his account of the civil war (2.53), for instance, julius caesar recounts a particularly ferocious day's fighting in which 'not a single one of the men was not wounded, and four centurions out of one cohort were blinded.' we can't read *too* much into this, but i think it's interesting that he establishes three categories of 'dead', 'wounded' and 'notably wounded', and then fills the latter only with men who lost their sight - which may suggest that there weren't many others left severely disabled, because those men hadn't survived. with that said, we do find prosthetics as archaeological remains (see the [capua leg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capua_leg#/media/file:roman_artificial_leg_of_bronze._wellcome_m0012307.jpg), for instance, buried with its owner around 300 bc), and accounts of people using them in literary sources - most famously, of the general marcus sergius silus, who lost his right hand during the second punic war and had it replaced with an iron one.^(2) robert garland even goes as far as to argue that dangerous work, unsanitary conditions, malnutrition, disease, illness, and aging would have made some level of disability 'so common as to be the norm.'  in one letter, written by pliny the younger in the early 2nd century ad, there's an account of a senator called gnaeus domitius tullus. as pliny tells it, tullus became almost totally paralysed sometime in middle or old age, and his account reveals a lot about how someone like him could adapt to life as well as the attitudes of roman society towards him:  &gt;it was thought most unsuitable that a woman of \[his wife's\] high birth and blameless character, who was no longer young, had borne children in the past and had long been widowed, should marry a wealthy old man and a hopeless invalid, whom even a wife who had known him when young and healthy might have found an object of disgust. crippled and deformed in every limb, he could only enjoy his vast wealth by contemplating it and could not even turn in bed without assistance. he also had to have his teeth cleaned and brushed for him ‚Äì a squalid and pitiful detail ‚Äì and when complaining about the humiliations of his infirmity was often heard to say that every day he licked the fingers of his slaves. yet he went on living, and kept his will to live, helped chiefly by his wife, whose devoted care turned the former criticism of her marriage into a tribute of admiration.^(3)  on one level, we have the support systems familiar throughout history - the family, here in particular his wife. on the other, we can see how tullus' 'vast wealth' was helpful in being able to pay for slaves and insulate him from the need to work to survive. jane draycott has also pointed out that the two stories of silus and tullus show different sides of the roman attitude to disability - the elder pliny used silus' disability to show his masculine virtue and defiance of it, while the younger presented tullus' condition as humiliating and as something for able-bodied people to look at and count their blessings.^(4) both stories, in other words, engage with disability only from the perspective and in the interests of able-bodied people: they aren't authentic disabled perspectives and aren't particularly concerned with recovering the disabled person's experience of life.  one issue that comes up regularly in this sort of study is that of infanticide - and this is very much a moving target in the last few years and even months, so i will try to prevaricate on that except to point to the work of scholars like debby sneed, who has material in press suggesting that much of what we 'know' about infanticide (in particular, the 'fact' that it was fairly common to expose or outright kill disabled newborns in the greek world) rests on shaky evidence and should be taken with a great deal of caution. there's an account in the late antique biography of st. martin, written by gregory of tours, that has some bearing on the matter:  &gt;at bourges a woman gave birth to a son, whose knees were bent up to his stomach; his heels were fastened to his legs, his hands hugged his chest, and his eyes were closed. he looked more like a monster than a human being. many looked at him with laughter and the poor mother was criticised because such a monster had come out of her. in tears, she confessed that she had conceived him on a sunday night. since she did not dare to kill him, she raised him as a healthy child, as mothers usually do. when he got older, she handed him over to beggars, who placed him on a cart and dragged him around, displaying him to the people, who gave lots of money to watch the prodigy. this went on for a long time, and when he reached the age of ten years, he arrived at saint martin‚Äôs feast. he was left outdoors and lay in misery before the saint‚Äôs tomb.  it's not sensible to try to reconstruct a 'diagnosis' from this story (as with all ancient 'historical' texts, it's fundamentally a work of literature and shouldn't necessarily be taken literally), but it does suggest that killing a disabled child was common or condoned enough that the mother would have to explain why she didn't do it. however, this is also far from the only story of a severely disabled person being displayed as a kind of 'freakshow' to beg for money, or even sold as a slave and curiosity. christian laes draws attention to the phrase 'as mothers usually do', suggesting that this may point to a social stereotype that *fathers* would normally kill a child in this position, but that mothers would be seen as more likely to raise the child.^(5) so we really have light on two points of ancient disability here - firstly, the possibility that a disabled child would simply not be allowed to live very long, and secondly, the sort of life that might await them if they did.  this is pretty much as far as we're able to go - if you flick through any of the volumes mentioned below, you'll find firstly that they overwhelmingly concentrate on disabilities 'above the neck' (that is, blindness, deafness, speech impairment and learning difficulties), and secondly that they overwhelmingly focus on (able-bodied peoples') attitudes towards disability and how disabled people were thought of, rather than being able to reconstruct life from their point of view. this is, unfortunately, a reflection of our sources - as ancient historians, we are always working with a highly partial set of evidence, which skews overwhelmingly towards the voices of mostly-able-bodied, elite men. going any further is really a matter of inference - and here i'd point you towards a recent article by debby sneed, who has noted that greek temples, particularly healing sanctuaries, often included ramps as part of their architecture, which seems to suggest that they were thinking about accessibility by people of limited mobility.^(6) you'll notice that i haven't even tried to limit the answer to the republican period, because the quantity of evidence there would drop from 'too little' to 'barely any'. ultimately, it becomes extremely difficult to write a history of ancient disability that isn't fundamentally a history of ancient attitudes to it.",1,,2
694979,"a few weeks, our english lit class went to bolton to see a midsummer night's dream. now we were expecting a 'modern interpretation', but we didn't know the definition would be spread that far.  the play began, all the characters arrived on stage, the men in military uniforms, the women wearing veils. the bottom row of seating was actually on the stage, with the seating flanking the stage front, left and right. me and my classmates we sat on the second row back, just above actor eye-level.  now, the audience is all in a hush, completely quiet as the cast begin to speak. then something starts to feel not right. my friend next to me is *vibrating* with suppressed giggles. more classmates sitting on the opposite side of the stage were also suppressing giggles, hands over their faces. and then i notice, one of the characters was a dwarf, about 3ft tall, wearing a veil. now normally, this wouldn't phase me. however, the effect of the near silent, packed, theatre and the knowledge that laughing would be an awful, awful thing, caused me to start to giggle, you know, the near uncontrollable desire to laugh out loud. the play was continuing. every now and then you could hear a funny noise from someone in the audience who had accidentally breathed and let out a little laugh. of course, the effect of one person giggling is toxic, you start to laugh at them laughing, starting a chain reaction.  the play lasted *three hours*. three hours of trying not to laugh, of rib-searing pain. at one point the dwarf got some bells and started to dance around the stage. the seating was literally shaking for that one.  for a portion of the play (at least a third), there were these multi-coloured balls covering the stage, of all sizes. some of the larger balls were larger than the dwarf. and *she was pushing them around*. when this happened, the college student behind us just lost it, letting out ripping laughter, luckily ignored.  another moment, the cast we running and chasing each other on stage, with lights flashing, loud music. seeing the dwarf pattering, jumping around just made most of the audience just completely lose it.  now the reason i don't feel so bad about this is because of what happened at the end of the play. i neglected to mention, for my own shame, that another of the characters was played by a guy in an electric wheelchair, who would whiz around the stage quite fast. he quite clearly had some sort of neural disorder (i later learned that it was cerebral palsy), but the cast had him out of chair, grovelling on the floor, pulling himself around with his arms. horrifically indecent, but i'll admit was a factor adding to the giggle-pressure. then the cast decided to, ahem, *dress the guy in the wheelchair as a wall*. on stage. in front of everyone. we sat for five minutes watching him trying to get a jumper on, as the cast lowered a fabric-covered bamboo frame over his chair. he then preceded to charge members of the audience, ramming them with the frame. in one scene, he deliberately reversed over the lead actor's foot and over his cape as he tried to walk about. then we realised. it was slapstick comedy, with the disabled. the disabled guy, we later found out was a comedian, in fact he was starring in a play titled 'spastic fantastic'.   the last thirty minutes would be hilarious for anyone who just walked into the theatre. we had spent so long giggling to ourselves, we were completely desensitised to anything.  the play ended with a dance. the dwarf pulled people on the front rows up to come and dance. my friend looked eye-to-eye with the lead actor and said he saw only misery and self-hate.  i will never forget that trip.",1,,-2
884607,"i'm not particularly capable of explaining this but autism is a kind of an intellectual disability. it renders one almost completely incapable of social interaction and also, a tendency to spouts of aggression. i can only really say that for you to realize this, you'd have to personally experience or see for yourself the behaviors of an autistic person.  from wiki ""the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments‚Äîwho may be silent, mentally disabled, and locked into hand flapping and rocking‚Äîto less impaired individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication.  the 'less-impaired' in this case is generally  considered asperger's. so asperger's is people who show mild symptoms of autism whereas autistics are 'disabled'. also, the thing is asperger's sufferers are also statistically meant to be more intelligent than the average person.  i personally find the whole concept of 'asperger's' kind of controversial, a lot of geeks and introverts could fulfill a lot of the criteria for being an asperger's sufferer albeit there are sincere sufferer's of the syndrome.  *edited.*",1,,0

164644,"i'm coming at this from a side angle and while, on the face of it, i think this is something you've obviously put a lot of effort into, there are awkward things about the premise that i think need some deeper thought and assistance with from someone who has themselves experienced deafness. if you have or have seen it in a loved one, i don't want to presume to speak over you and your lived experience, so ignore the rest of this post. but if you don't have direct experience of deafness, please be **very** careful with this entire particular plot trajectory.  honestly, as disabled myself, to have a disability-negating superpower would be awesome. it would mean i get so much more done and could live independently in a much more dignified and comfortable manner than i do at present. **however,** some deaf people may be uncomfortable with the idea of a specific superpower that negates hearing or restores the character magically to a similar position as a hearing person. also, prominent historical figures in pre-industrial society have been deaf and got on just fine in professions that usually require the ability to hear. so sometimes the idea of curing something magically isn't even necessary.  so tbh i would think more about the actual disability and how to portray something that actually can't be overcome purely by mundane physical means and requires the princess to adopt telepathy instead, and perhaps doesn't tread on the toes of a *very* sensitive community who genuinely don't like the idea of being 'cured'. particularly if the princess is deaf, rejected by society as somehow 'broken' and healed magically, it could come across as assuming the deaf all feel that way. if presented as a temptation with major drawbacks, that might be ok, but the word 'superpower' connotes a situation where the telepathy is a means to an end and is cool and allows her to go on adventures with her hearing friends. the princess explicitly *losing* her hearing might be an idea, but tbh this is such a touchy subject for absolutely genuine reasons within disability activism that i would honestly think it's better not to stir the hornet's nest on this one if this isn't an own voices issue. please do research into actual experience of disabilities if you are not disabled yourself, particularly if you're using a disability such as deafness where there is a lot of community solidarity established within the social justice movement and who do form an identity and community around their situation.  additionally, in real life things like hearing aids and implants exist for those who want them, particularly after direct hearing loss as opposed to being born with no hearing at all. however, that begs the question to me that if they are deaf and want to overcome that deafness, there are physical things that can be done to assist, from sign language to the use and interpretation of vibration that can compensate, even if the society lacks the technology to produce a hearing aid. in the late 18th/early 19th century before modern medicine had tackled the problem, beethoven could 'hear' through feeling vibration so a technologically challenged society may not need magic in this instance.   don't be shy of expressing a general 'curing the disabled' sentiment, because lots of us actually feel that coping mechanisms are no substitute for being free of mental and physical disabilities. we're not all 'differently abled'; some of us really do have faulty neurological wiring or direct physical issues that prevents us being who we want to be in ways that are distinctly handicapped over and above personal background and social identity. my husband has the ultimate disability -- he's dead -- and before that had cancer, classed in the uk as a disability but one that i'm sure that even the most ardent identity activist would accept needed medical intervention to keep him alive as long as we possibly could. even the most up to date therapies were no match for the very aggressive disease that he had. he made his peace with death eventually and i believe he even chose to die when he had just had enough. we spent a week with him in hospital and my mother was in tears begging the doctors to expedite a hospice bed. in the uk, while healthcare is free and universal, the hospital norm is a shared ward rather than private rooms. the beds don't extend far enough for a six foot man to stretch out in comfort. he was in a ward amongst men twice his age for the best part of his last week alive and we struggled even to get him privacy. when he got the hospice bed, he stretched out, relaxed in a bed he could fit into and...checked out.  but no-one would say that in that last week, if someone had told him -- bam, you're magically cured, you can go home, go back to work, go back to playing sport, driving and going to the cinema, because we've even cured the epilepsy brought on by your previous brain tumour -- he wouldn't have grabbed the cure with both hands. up until the last afternoon, he was desperate to get back on his chemo treatment which he'd had to stop due to an infection. he did consider not continuing with treatment at one point after a seizure a year prior to that, but then he happened to look through some old files, including our wedding memory box, and changed his mind because he realised he did still have things to live for. miraculously his chemotherapy worked on the brain and relieved the swelling before the doctors even needed to operate again. he had a good christmas and even started back at work again for a while before the disease took another shot at him. but at no point would he have turned down the chance to *no longer have cancer*.  the experience of someone who loses a function in their body and senses is different to that of someone born with a condition, and the problem with *some* disability activism is that it tries to impose another orthodoxy on those of us who are actively handicapped by our conditions rather than simply being forced to live in a society that sees them as less than they really are. there's a struggle between those for whom society is the biggest obstacle to integration and those for whom their body and mind is the biggest problem. we latter folks tend to get forgotten about because the civil rights paradigm we're currently using is all about identity within society rather than a more nuanced and honest look at medical capacity and the ways of compensating for physical and mental disadvantages that aren't purely social in nature. but folks like the deaf community feel differently and no fiction can be entirely divorced from real world perspectives. a deaf princess would be cool, but there is always an assumption amongst hearing people that deafness is something to be cured rather than accepted as a simple variant from the norm. if you want to tackle disability as a subject and impose a magical cure, maybe find a disability with a much more directly negative impact on the individual. my husband would have killed for a magical cure for his cancer. so would i for my 'brain in a jar' situation, to be honest, where i have the knowledge and focus to do things well but not the spatial and strategic thinking to put them into practice.   (the pandemic, with its resultant use of mouth-obscuring masks and hence speech being less clearly intelligible to other people, is introducing us hearing folk to the strange world of having to try and compensate for a lack of function that we take for granted, while also stopping the deaf from lip-reading. i'd be the last person to crow about having an enforced handicap as life with dyspraxia and asperger's is pretty shit and i wouldn't wish it on anyone. my husband and i decided not to have children because his family had a history of dicky kidneys from which he actually ended up dying after a cancerous mutation, and my genes aren't exactly the ones i want to inflict on another person if asperger's is hereditary. but it really does make you understand what other people struggle with and helps you understand the practical frustrations of a deaf person in hearing society and work to better understanding of the challenges and needs they have rather than just thinking 'oh, they can't hear, they need a hearing aid'. something as simple as the princess' friends learning sign language might be an assistance itself: the deaf community in britain is campaigning for our variant of sign language to be taught in schools, which is long past due.   (my grandfather was the patron of a deaf school in the 1960s in northern ireland and just listening to my (hearing) mother talk about it shows us how far we've come in understanding that deaf shouldn't mean marginalised in the way i think they kind of were. i can imagine my grandfather being a straight up guy as regards his stewardship of the school. i never knew him as an adult -- he died when i was about twenty -- but he was awesome in most other regards and deeply caring almost to a fault about us as children. he would have taken his duties there as seriously as he took his duty to his family. however, he may well have bought into the ethos of the time regarding disability and the capability of people who have a simple lack of function in part of their physical body which doesn't extend to being mentally deficient, an assumption that is probably to blame for deaf people being made to feel isolated and rejected by society as a whole.)   personally, as a hearing person, i would suggest leaving deafness well alone unless you have some direct personal relationship with hearing impairment or loss, or are a member of the deaf community. it's not worth the aggravation and upset you might cause here to people who have struggled to be seen as just as capable as those who can hear, and in addition the physically deaf have ways and means of adjusting to hearing society that don't involve technology or magic, such that the princess simply wouldn't need the poisoned chalice of telepathy.",1,,2

please be detailed. what was the hardest part about growing up as a child with cp? at what point did your parents know your brain injury was only physical?  i also see via this thread's other comments that a ""i have cp"" ama would be pertinent...|i was born pretty prematurely because of my mom having a physical deformity in her uterus that made it so i couldn't go to term. she wasn't aware of it until after the fact, but this was the 80s so it's possible it could have just gone undetected, i'm not sure.  the hardest part of growing up with cp came about in middle school when i realized that most people's questions that i thought were genuine were actually just a way to make fun of me or laugh at me behind my back. going forward from there i didn't have a lot of friends because i knew a lot of people didn't like me and that i was different. being bullied like that really fucking sucks and it's caused a lot of social anxiety over the years.  they found out about me having cp when i was one after i wasn't meeting physical milestones like a normal baby would but they didn't find out about the mental part of it until i was a bit older, about two when i started talking and interacting more|[here](/r/ama/comments/83l9bd/im_a_physically_disabled_mom_of_3_with_one_on_the/dvj074o/) i too am disabled with a degenerative bone disease and i have kids (and i'm trying for another)  i know having sex is hard being disabled. do you use a sex swing or anything else to help make sex easier (and more enjoyable)?|no, though it is something we have thought about getting. a lot of it for us is  mostly trial and error, some positions work better than others and there are days when the same position that worked before won't work that day. it just depends on how i feel and we do what is most comfortable at the time|[here](/r/ama/comments/83l9bd/im_a_physically_disabled_mom_of_3_with_one_on_the/dvj0w00/) if its mostly but not always caused by trauma at birth were you able to sue the dr/hospital who delivered you?|good question. i'm not sure if my mom ever took any sort of action. i'll have to ask her.  she did a damn good job raising me despite the disability, i'll say that much|[here](/r/ama/comments/83l9bd/im_a_physically_disabled_mom_of_3_with_one_on_the/dvixfh1/) why would you want to potentially carry on your genetic disease?|its not genetic, it's mainly caused by trauma at birth|[here](/r/ama/comments/83l9bd/im_a_physically_disabled_mom_of_3_with_one_on_the/dvj5kq4/) i have a son with autism, he has two friends with cp! i have a few questions. do you know what caused your cp? was it in utero or during birth? do you have any co occurring diagnoses? did you attend therapy as a kid- speech, ot, pt? what was most helpful? how did you meet your husband? did you have to have c sections?|i don't know much other than my mom had a physical issue with her uterus that caused me to not go to term. i'm not sure if the cerebral palsy came on at that point or if it was during labor / birth - she was in labor for quite some time.  i do not have any co-occurring diagnosis, just the  cp.  i met my husband on a dating website, we've been together for almost 4 years.  my oldest daughter was a c-section but my two younger ones were vaginal deliveries and i'm hoping for the same for this one but healthy is what's most important|[here](/r/ama/comments/83l9bd/im_a_physically_disabled_mom_of_3_with_one_on_the/dvj7h6h/)  --- [source] (https://github.com/johnsliao/ama_compiler)",1,,1

520809,"&gt; in the article, she's literally quoted as saying she is unable to pick up her own child. is that really doing just fine?  just opened the link. i'm assuming that the *father* is able to pick up his own child?  ah, i see the article says:  &gt; fortunately, she gets help from a carer who comes five days a week to help out with hayden, **though her husband definitely takes primary care of the baby.**  so this couple has an aide that assists the mom with the baby, plus the father is apparently capable of taking care of the baby, too.      &gt; i'm not saying that everyone with a disability should be banned from having kids. &gt;  &gt; however i do think it's wrong to have children when they have a huge risk of inheriting extreme disabilities, physical or mental. that's not fair to the child, that's not a fair life for them. i think it's extremely selfish.   you and i are somewhat in agreement on this.  i believe we should use the best science available to us so that all aspiring parents--disabled or not--can be advised of their risks of passing on any severe disabilities to any offspring, with a particular emphasis on the concept ""just because you're able to live fully with your version of your particular disorder doesn't meant that your kid won't get a worse version, and it doesn't meant that your kid won't have a much harder time living with it.""  but per your link, the mother's condition is quite rare, and there's no mention of it being heritable.  that would imply that the kid's chances of inheriting that condition or passing it on, are significantly reduced.  honestly, from the sound of things, the biggest issue for this woman was her physical size during the course of the pregnancy:  &gt; doctors were initially concerned ms psaila, who is just 122cm or 4 feet tall, would be too small to allow her baby to grow normally.   having known a couple of very short moms who weren't disabled (such as the mother of one of my best friends; the woman is 90 lbs soaking wet and birthed three kids who went on to become extremely successful adults), the above is not a concern limited to just people with disabilities.  i personally would've been way more concerned about this:  &gt; ...her husband chris, who has a hereditary condition that caused damage to his lower spine  the writer doesn't name the condition or mention if the husband's condition is rare or not, so while the kid seems healthy right now, we don't know if he has a condition that will present later in life.  given what we don't know, i'm unwilling to speculate.  &gt; the problem i have is how much that puts the child at risk. she can't stop him from walking into the pool  wait...where does it say that the couple owns a pool?  the mom mentions going swimming, but the article doesn't mention where.  i assumed they meant a public pool or therapeutic pool, the sort of  place where babies/toddlers/small children were permitted and life guards would be present.  beyond the uncertainty around the pool, you seem to be assuming that physically disabled mother = child will die screaming.  that's the conclusion-jumping i'm talking about.  far too many people make those sort of assumptions about disabled parents.  in the time magazine article i linked, for example, a visually impaired couple lost custody of their sighted child solely because the child was having difficulty latching on for breastfeeding.  difficulty latching is incredibly common with babies and has absolutely nothing at all do with whether or not either parent can see.  but because people at cps assumed that ""physically disabled mother = child will die screaming"", this perfectly capable couple lost custody for two months and had to go to court to get their kid back.  ""disabled parent = automatically incompetent to take care of a baby"" is a really ugly form of prejudice against people living with disabilities.  it leads to particularly nasty discrimination and a lot of awful pain and heartbreak for both the parents and the children.  an able-bodied person can neglect her child for years and cps will refuse to remove the child from the home.  but let a disabled parent not hand her child a tissue fast enough when it sneezes,. and boom!  cps is all over them like fleas on a dog.  as i said, i'm all for encouraging aspiring parents to know what they could be passing on before they get pregnant.  but if a couple has a kid, and both parents and kid are doing well...what's the problem?  just because you've assumed that the parents don't know what they're doing doesn't mean that they don't.  &gt; she can't lift him up if he is suffocating in his crib  she has a husband who is described the baby's primary caregiver.  presumably he would do that lifting if required.  &gt; and you're right, it is my opinion. i am quite outraged that they would subject a child to this kind of life just so they can have one.   based on the article, i'm not convinced that this child is being subjected to anything.  &gt; and honestly, i think you're jumping to conclusions that the parents would have carefully thought about the risks and the challenges.   in my opinion, it's very clear that they did not think about it.   from the look of both the article and the photos (with a clearly thriving baby featured in them), i don't think i'm jumping to conclusions.  i think you saw the article, saw that this woman isn't able to be the baby's primary caregiver, and assumed that therefore the baby cannot help but suffer.  this couple had a child under circumstances that--were i not childfree--i and many others would refuse to.  if i've understood the article correctly, the father acts as the primary caregiver in much the same way that a single dad or widower might.  the mother, besides giving birth, is likely just along for the ride when it comes to day-to-day stuff.  are these ideal circumstances for becoming a parent?  of course not.  is this article needlessly hyperbolic about the miracle of birth and what-not?  of course it is--it originated from the daily ~~fail~~ mail, for heaven's sake.  but when you ignore the hyperbole and concentrate on the facts presented--which, admittedly, aren't abundant in this article because it's from the daily ~~fail~~ mail and for them, facts are optional--the situation of this couple strikes me as analogous to the old traditional gender role parenting of years past, where one parent takes care of the baby and the other parent, while present, isn't involved in a hands-on way.  except here, the genders are reversed--the dad does the primary caregiving work while the mom interacts with the child the way a 9-5 dad would've back in the 1950s and earlier: hugs, kisses, some fun stuff, but the real work belongs to the other parent.  and there's also the aide that comes in, so that's a bit like having a part-time nanny.  again, these are not ideal circumstances in the 21st century, where the expectation is that both parents try to split parenting duties equally, *sans* a nanny.  but unlike the '50s, this parenting dynamic isn't the result of sexism.  it's what works best for those parents living with their particular disabilities, and their child.  quite frankly, given the widespread and pervasive prejudice against disabled parents, if these parents messed up even the slightest bit in caring for this child, that child would be taken from them at light speed.      an able-bodied person can neglect her child for years and cps will refuse to remove the child from the home.  but let a disabled parent not hand her child a kleenex fast enough when it sneezes,. and boom!  cps is all over them like fleas on a dog.  the fact that the kid is still living with them implies that these parents have all their ducks in a row when it comes to caregiving.  i understand that your post was a rant and solely your opinion.  but i find your opinion to be poorly reasoned and at least partly informed by bias against disabled parents.",1,,-2
563901,"often resembling a reformatory, a poorhouse often housed orphaned children, families, destitute elderly, physically handicapped, mentally unstable, morally corrupt, even criminals. these institutions were situated on the grounds of a poor farm on which able-bodied residents were required to work; such farms were common in the united states in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  a poorhouse (sometimes referred to as almshouse or asylum) was a government-run facility for the support and housing of dependent or needy persons, typically run by a local government entity such as a county or municipality, and institutions of this nature were widespread in the united states prior to the adoption of the social security program in the 1930s.  on december 4, 1826 the genesee county board of supervisors met in bethany for the purpose of establishing a county poorhouse. a brick building, originally a stagecoach tavern, located near the corner of the bethany center road and raymond road was the site selected, as it represented the geographical center of the county.

244741,"&gt;i've given you an objective assessment that everything you've told me is equal to every other ""nerd"" out there. (i'm not talking about the wannabe nerds either, but real nerds)  i went to wpi with people who did nothing all day but code debuggers and play 7 games of minesweeper at once.  you are judging my personality by a web conversation.  i contend that i was not like any of the -real nerds- there, nor were most of them like each other.  &gt;so you reject the previous labels of adhd and autism in favor for a cooler label.  i was labelled as.  as is a form of autism.  that's the only autism label i was given.  i was labelled adhd during the add-hayday.  i seriously lack the symptoms of adhd except for being described as ""different"" and having trouble making friends.  i have more than enough symptoms of aspergers syndrome, though i admit as is probably a few disorders stuffed together considering how many very specific and seemingly unrelated symptoms are involved with a standard (you need 20 of these 50).  nonetheless, i respect labels given by psychology; i don't take drugs or disorder-specific counseling for those labels.  the only ever counseling i had was for my social skills; period.  &gt;you should forward this book to half my college science professors. you could consider it a ""paying forward"" project.  it was body language i learned from books and webpages.  the monotone i taught myself from experience and being around my then-fiance (she would call me on talking monotone or when i stopped portraying emotions in my speech).  &gt;everyone can claim a mild-disorder-level label in something  sure...i don't consider average learning a disability.  i consider below average learning a disability.  my public school system has 'special needs' classes for people with learning disabilities.  i consider below-average capacity to pick up socialization, and the inability to make friends, a disability.  i was unable to make any friends for a significant portion of my life.  if that is 'normal', then the school system needs to teach people to be able to make friends as part of its standard curriculum.  lack of friends slowed my emotional development and led to an ego.  you hit that nail on the head 15 years too late.  i got over that, but it didn't help my already bad social skills back then.  &gt;everything you've said about your life's accomplishments has been driven by intelligence  yeah, but you have what you succeed at, and what you dream of.  my dreams had me working a low level desk job with a wife, kids, and a bunch of friends.  i'm single, making decent money, with a few friends.  i missed the mark and picked up the pieces.  i am proud that i picked up a few friendships, but i still consider that well missing my goals.  &gt;you would have said the father was stupid to remove his kid from the social benefits of hs  i'm not convinced that the school systems are particularly beneficial.  my lack of social skills -hurt- my learning in hs, but my social skills never actually improved.  i guess i'm stuck in the paradigm of ""school will not help a socially-incapable person catch up, it only helps the socially-capable get better"".  &gt;after all you have a disease and you can't be held responsible for being better, its a natural fact.  you really gotta stick to diagnosing people in person.  you're completely misinterpreting the intent behind the things i've said.  i have *never once* in my life leaned on my as.  i look back at my past and decide it was as, and not effort, that caused me a decade of no friends.  i modified my -methods- of trying to make friends based upon that.  if someone has a muscle problem in their hand, and it gives them bad handwriting, telling them they're making excuses will keep the handwriting bad.  telling them they have a muscle problem and letting them find their way to change the problem instead of the symptom, means that a motivated person is more likely to succeed.  and i succeeded.  had i continued to assume ""i just have a little catching up to do"", i would not have succeeded.  &gt;think we're at an impasse here, i think we equally understand each others position. i just honestly think you're deceiving yourself and you are saying you have irrefutable evidence of disease.  and i honestly think you're continuing to grab one thing i say and profile me, as inaccurately as the diagnosis may have been.  if i throw out the name ""aspergers syndrome"" and list my symptoms and possible causes in an unnamed manner (which would require a much stronger grasp of phsychology than i have), i would've taken the same steps i took today.  if i threw it all out, i'd have done things differently and been far behind where i am today.

agster, a 33-year-old mentally handicapped man, died in the county jail three days after being forced by sheriff's officers into a restraint chair used for controlling combative arrestees. agster's parents had been taking him to a psychiatric hospital because he was exhibiting paranoia, then called police when he refused to leave a convenience store where they had stopped enroute. officers took agster to the madison street jail, placed a ""spit hood"" over his face and strapped him to the chair, where he had an apparent seizure and lost consciousness. he was declared brain dead three days later.  &gt;&gt;**scott norberg**  &gt;&gt;during his internment, evidence suggests detention officers shocked norberg several times with a stun-gun. according to an investigation by amnesty international, norberg was already handcuffed and face down when officers dragged him from his cell and placed him in a restraint chair with a towel covering his face. after norberg's corpse was discovered, detention officers accused norberg of attacking them as they were trying to restrain him.  &gt;&gt;**brian crenshaw**  &gt;&gt;brian crenshaw was a legally blind and mentally disabled

because of his injuries, post has lost much of the use of his arms.  &gt;&gt;**jeremy flanders**  &gt;&gt;in 1996, jeremy flanders was attacked by inmates at tent city who used rebar tent stakes, which were not concreted into the ground. although these stakes had been used as weapons in a previous riot at the facility, the sheriff's office chose not to secure them properly. during the trial, the plaintiff ""presented evidence that, among other things, the sheriff and his deputies had actual knowledge that prisoners used rebar tent stakes and tent poles as weapons and did nothing to prevent it."" furthermore, ""the sheriff admitted knowing about, and in fact intentionally designing, some conditions at tent city that created a substantial risk of inmate violence."" after the attack: ""another inmate entered the tent and found flanders unconscious, gasping for air, and spewing blood out of his mouth, nose and ears. flanders had been bloodied and beaten so badly that the other inmate initially did not recognize flanders."" flanders suffered permanent brain damage as a result of the attack. on appeal, flanders was awarded $635,532, of which arpaio was personally responsible for thirty-five percent.  &gt;&gt;**ambria renee spencer**  &gt;&gt;in 2006, inmate ambrett spencer, who was incarcerated for drunk driving and was nine months pregnant with a healthy girl, complained of severe stomach pains and asked for medical attention. the infirmary nurse, who had no prenatal training, believed the pain was not an emergency. it was two hours before an ambulance was called for spencer, who in the meantime had passed out from severely low blood pressure and lost so much color that the emt who arrived at the scene said he knew she was ""not getting enough blood to [her] organs and skin."" at the hospital‚Äîfour hours after first reporting pain‚Äîspencer gave birth to a dead daughter, ambria renee. it was determined that spencer's pain had been caused by placental abruption, internal bleeding resulting in loss of blood to the baby, which babies can usually survive if the mother is taken to the hospital and labor is quickly induced.

[this was my lifting highlight of the year](https://www.instagram.com/p/cc38hdvqwup/).      high handle trap bar deadlift, 470lb for 7 reps, with an estimated 1-2 reps in the tank. this one is my favorite because of how easy it felt and how easy it looks! i set out to beat a pr, and had a rep goal in mind, which i passed easily. when i first watched the video i did kick myself _a bit_ for not going for extras. also, my arm looks kind of big. ü§£       [my 2nd place highlight was this cheaty overhead lift](https://www.instagram.com/p/casozzhkp_o/).      overhead press w/ leg drive, 215lb for 1 rep. this one was satisfying because [i failed it two weeks before](https://www.instagram.com/p/cal65tuq2qj/), but i knew the strength was there. i could have had it with better technique/a cleaner attempt. i was right! previous to this i had only lifted &gt;200lb overhead a small handful of times (in the weeks leading up to it). it was also a &gt;bw overhead milestone ‚Äì my bodyweight was ~210lb, so this was +5. it was not a strict lift, but i don't care about that.      **2023 goals**      i have purposely stayed away from 1rm goals, many milestone goals, and actually most numbers-oriented goals as a whole for the past few years. i think this has served me well, as that kind of goal-setting doesn't seem to work very well _for me._      with that said, these are my basic training goals for 2023:      1.  continue getting stronger across the board. keep chipping away at becoming just stronger and more muscular overall.     2.  my main physique goal for 2023 will actually be a successful cut after this winter bulking phase is over. i would like to get leaner than i've been since late 2019/early 2020.     3.  squat a weight i am not embarrassed of. front squat or back squat.     4.  a 600lb high handle trap bar deadlift would be amazing. i don't care that it is a cheater ego lift ‚Äì i like it and it's fun. i would settle for a good rep pr well into the 500s.     5.  can this finally be the year i bench &gt;300lb? three plates? we'll see. i would also be happy with a good rep pr at 275lb.           everything else is basically neither here nor there ‚Äì and hey, my goals might even morph throughout the year, and that's ok.      _**pontificating...**_      this year has not been the greatest for me. many areas of my life have suffered, and i enter the new year in a deep depression. there are a lot of things that need attention and work.      but things are not all bad. i also did many fun things and went to cool places. i got my motorcycle endorsement and put almost 3,000 miles on the bike i bought last fall. explored new areas and spent a lot of time learning a new skill.      and my physical health, as far as i can tell, is good!      while i sit here and reflect, i can truthfully say how grateful i am that i've let training become such a consistent piece of my life, and how proud of myself i am for having stuck with it. i am not the most gifted lifter, not the biggest, not the strongest ‚Äì not the most creative or entertaining.      training has come to have a centering effect on my life, though. it has a way of helping me re-establish a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when i drift off-course, or when things seem chaotic. if i can get back into a groove of doing this one thing i've come to appreciate, it at least _helps_ draw some other things in.      and that's pretty cool. so even if i don't set monster prs or put up amazing numbers, i think as long as i keep doing it, that will be just fine.",0,,

863825,"&gt;  &gt; colonel berry had to have remote monitoring for his astronaut patients. for me it may not have been utterly necessary. but it did mean that i was not cluttered with dozens of wires like a fly caught in a web; the microminiaturized sensors were so small and unobtrusive that i never noticed them-yet the nurses had the full picture every minute, every second. &gt;  &gt; another advantage of telemetered remote monitoring is that more than one terminal can display the signals. my wife tells me that there was one at the nursing supervisor's station. dr. chater may have had a terminal in his offices-i don't know. but there can't be any difficulty in remoting a hundred yards or so when the technology was developed for remoting from luna to houston, almost a quarter of a million miles. &gt;  &gt; space spinoff in postoperative care: a doppler ultrasound stethoscope is an impressive example of microminiaturization. it is enormously more sensitive than an acoustic stethoscope; the gain can be controlled, and, because of its doppler nature, fluid flow volume and direction can be inferred by a skilled operator. being ultrasound at extremely high frequency, it is highly directional; an acoustic stethoscope is not. &gt;  &gt; it generates a tight beam of ultrasound beyond the range of the human ear. this beam strikes something and bounces back, causing interference beats in the audible range. it behaves much like doppler radar save that the radiation is ultrasound rather than electromagnetic. thus it is a non invasive way to explore inside the body without the dangers of x-ray . . . and is able to 'see' soft tissues that x-ray can't see. &gt;  &gt; both characteristics make it especially useful for protecting pregnant mothers and unborn babies. i am not departing from the call; babies unborn and newly born, and mothers at term must be classed as 'temporarily but severely handicapped.' &gt;  &gt; doppler ultrasound was used on me before, during, and after surgery. &gt;  &gt; after my convalescence i was again examined by computerized axial tomography. no abnormalities-- other than the new plate in my skull. &gt;  &gt; this brain surgery is not itself a spinoff from space technology . . . but note how repeatedly space spinoffs were used on me before, during, and after surgery. this operation is very touchy; in the whole world only a handful of surgical teams dare attempt it. of the thousand-odd of these operations to date, worldwide, dr. chater has performed more than 300. his mortality rate is far lower than that of any other team anywhere. this is a tribute to his skill but part of it comes from his attitude: he always uses the latest, most sophisticated tools available. &gt;  &gt; i was far gone; i needed every edge possible. several things that tipped the odds in my favor are spinoffs from space technology. &gt;  &gt; was it worthwhile? yes, even if i had died at one of the four critical points-because sinking into senility while one is still bright enough to realize that one's mental powers are steadily failing is a miserable, nogood way to live. early last year i was just smart enough to realize that i had nothing left to look forward to, nothing whatever. this caused me to be quite willing to 'go-for-broke'-get well or die. &gt;  &gt; did it work? i have been out of convalescence about one year, during which i've caught up on two years of technical journals, resumed studying-i have long been convinced that life-long learning helps to keep one young and happy. true or not, both my wife and i do this. at present tam reviewing symbolic logic, going on into more advanced n-dimensional, non-euclidean geometries, plus another subject quite new to me: chinese history. &gt;  &gt; but i am working, too; i have completed writing a very long novel and am about halfway through another book. &gt;  &gt; i feel that i have proved one of two things: either i have fully recovered.. . or a hole in the head is no handicap to a science-fiction author. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; i must note one spinoff especially important to the aged and the handicapped: spiritual spinoff. &gt;  &gt; 'man does not live by bread alone.' any physician will tell you that the most important factor in getting well is the will to live-contrariwise, a terminal patient dies when he gives up the fight. &gt;  &gt; i have been in death row three times. the unfailing support of my wife sustained my will to live.. . so here i am. in addition i have believed firmly in space flight for the past sixty-odd years; this has been a permanent incentive to hang on, hang on! my wife shares this; she decided years back to die on the moon, not here in the smog and the crowds. now that i am well again i intend to hang in there, lead a disciplined life, stay alive until we can buy commercial tickets to the moon . . . and spend our last days in low-gravity comfort in the luna hilton, six levels down in luna city. &gt;  &gt; foolishness? everyone in this room is old enough to know by direct experience that today's foolishness is tomorrow's wisdom. i can remember when 'get a horse!' was considered the height of wit. as may be, anything that gives one a strong incentive to live can't be entirely foolish. &gt;  &gt; i get a flood of mail from my readers; a disproportionate part of it is from the very old and the handicapped. it is impossible to be a fan of my fiction and not be enthusiastic for space travel. besides, they tell me so, explicitly, in writing. &gt;  &gt; examples: &gt;  &gt; a college professor, blind from birth. he's never seen the the stars; he's never seen the moon. the books he reads and rereads-has read to him by his secretary-are about space travel. he went to a lot of trouble to look me up. . . to discuss our space program. &gt;  &gt; a teen-age boy, tied to a wheelchair, who wrote to ask me whether or not he could become an astronautical engineer-some 'friend' had told him that it was a silly ambition for a cripple. i assured him that an engineer did not need legs even on earth surface, advised him in what courses to take, and referred him to a story by arthur c. clarke in which a double amputee, both legs, commands a space station. &gt;  &gt; a housewife with epilepsy, grand mal, who doesn't expect ever to be able to go out into space. . . but finds her greatest interest in life, her major relief from the tedious routine she must follow, in our space program. &gt;  &gt; avery large number of elderly people who wrote to me immediately after the first landing on the moon, all saying, in effect, that they thanked the lord that they had been spared long enough to see this great day. &gt;  &gt; i could add examples endlessly. just let me state flatly that my files hold proof that the aged retired, the shut-ins and the disabled of all ages get more spiritual lift out of space flight than does any other definable group of our citizens. for many of them the television screen is their only window on the world; something great and shining and wonderful went out of their lives when the apollo moon program ended. &gt;  &gt; even if a space program had no other spinoff, isn't that sort worth $0.05 a day?""",1,,2
944509,ok. to me being disabled means you have a disability of any kind. you're either 100% disabled or your 0% disabled. this percentage thing is just a rating system the military used to assess benefits. there's obviously a line somewhere between having a nick on your thumb and losing a thumb that defines a disability. i'd say that mccain is over that line. people often say very flippantly that john mccain can't raise his arms above his head. i'm sure this is just the most obvious outward sign. there's probably more to it than that.  imagine a person who had been physically injured to the point they could not raise their arms coming into your office asking for a job and presented a disability card. would you tell that person that they weren't disabled. i doubt it. i doubt you would consider them a hypocrite either for wanting to work.  being disabled means you have a physical or mental handicap. it doesn't necessarily mean that you can't do an important job. i'm sure a deaf president would do just fine.,1,,1
323916,"1: that's fairly normal. the foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. if it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. but in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. it might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so i wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. if it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, i don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. i hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  i know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, i really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. but here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/penis-health/pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. and it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. but, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. i wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. it isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.  but every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.  5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. your reaction is up to you.  most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. so doing it quick and only short glances is best. but curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  it isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  but eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. it's one of those things you get used to. when you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. nobody really does tbh.",0,,
901712,"so there's a lot to unpack here, i'll try to keep it to the unedited abridged version since i'm a bit short on free time.  the tldr is that there is a pretty wide gulf between what [research results actually say and what makes it into the headlines](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=1623) of newspapers/non-academic journals/etc. along with a lot of underselling of the problem‚Äôs scale and difficulty.  first things first:    &gt; games where you [use your brain as a controller]  anything that is marketed like that is 99% bollocks.  for the sake of argument i will assume you are referring to [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1544851629/throw-trucks-with-your-mind), but there are a bunch of similar things floating around.  you see they are using a grand total of, maybe, 4 electrodes with sub-par contact to the person (no conducting gel and their placement varies with the size of the person).  with that setup you aren't going to be able to detect any kind of eeg signal at all in any meaningful sense.  what you *will* detect is the order of magnitudes higher electrical field produced by the muscles in the person's forehead.  the game isn't reading your thoughts about if you want to push things lightly or not, its just detecting if you blinked or raised an eyebrow.    &gt; brain-controlled prosthetics  to start, lets look at the simpler side of prosthetics, such as those used by [that one girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1kyyg2/iama_amputee_girl_with_bionic_arm_and_bow_from/) you might recognize.  as far as commercially-viable devices go this is not the most high-tech out there i think, but it is probably 2nd best and so should be a reasonable example.  she can do [some fancy stuff](http://i.imgur.com/lz0eviy.gif) with that thing.  but again this isn't reading brain signals, or even peripheral nervous activity, at all.  its detecting the activation of muscles that still work normally.  ever play a fighting game on the wii and notice how swinging the remote up or down doesn't give you fine control over your character, it just acts like your typical d-pad input?  same thing here.  the [sensors in the base of the arm](https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1kyyg2/iama_amputee_girl_with_bionic_arm_and_bow_from/cbu1sc0/) detect when she twitches her bicep, which causes the device to independently open/close the hand.  she doesn't even have fine control over it, it moves as quickly and strongly as its firmware was pre-programmed to operate at via gain scheduling.    what about eye implants or hearing aids?  it‚Äôs the same issue, they still are not interfacing with the brain at all they are just hijacking the peripheral nerve(s) and manually stimulate the system.  this is probably where you will see the most advancement in the near future because peripheral nerves generally have a clear purpose/method of action once you get far enough away from the spine.  stimulate nerve x to activate muscle y or to simulate activation of touch receptor z or what have you.  *this* is the sort of thing where you can treat the brain as a black box and interface with the peripheral nerves as if they were pinouts on an integrated circuit.    but enough about that boring stuff, you want cutting edge brain-computer interfacing a la [braingate](http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/03/braingate2_implants_allow_paralyzed_cleveland_veteran.html).  put some electrodes into a guy's head and suddenly you have a quadriplegic who can control a robotic arm!  not only that, but it works intuitively:  he doesn't have to think about wiggling his toe or about how awesome boobs are in order for the hand to move like previous systems, he just things about moving his hand in the appropriate direction and off it goes.    &gt; so where's the problem?  **1)  generalizability**  how many people have used a system like this?  less than 10.  total.  ever.  sure, it worked in 1 guy with tetraplegia.  what about someone with a stroke?  or a stroke *and* tetraplegia?  or even just a different person with the same diagnosis?  the fact is that these researchers spent multiple years tuning and then over-tuning the system to work with this one specific person's brain patterns without much thought into how it might work with different people.  if you want a brain-brain network interface, its going to take at least that much time (call it 1 year of training and tuning parameters per person) for it to work with your direct participants, let alone making something that can work with everyone.    **2)  problem complexity and scale**  we have the motor cortex mapped out (mostly).  you zap a person in one spot, their hand moves.  another, their nose twitches.  easy.  50+ years of research put to good use.    but the other 95% of it is still just a vague lump of watery meat that we don‚Äôt really understand and which is orders of magnitude more difficult to map out.  with the motor cortex you can thread a tiny little electrode in between a few surface neurons and get a clear output when you stimulate them.  not so much with the rest of it.  how do you figure out that someone is just thinking about moving their hand, but doesn‚Äôt actually want to move their hand?  how do you figure out where proprioceptive feedback (a sense so intuitive that you aren‚Äôt even consciously aware of using it) is incorporated in the brain?  how do you figure out if stimulating parts of the language processing centers allows the person to intuit meaning?  if you stimulate a memory center, how do you figure out if you implanted a memory, erased a memory, nothing happened, or if the person naturally forgot something or generated their own false memory?  and that‚Äôs assuming you are hitting the right spot with the right patterns, because our understanding of that kind of stuff right now amounts to ‚Äúthe hypothalamus is involved in memory somehow, we think.  well, taking parts away seems to prevent formations of new ones sometimes.‚Äù  even getting information to/from neurons not directly on the surface of the brain has been a major challenge.    heck, a large amount of neuroscience (depression medications, deep brain stimulation, etc) is used completely blindly when it comes to clinical applications.  we put a probe into a guy‚Äôs head and it seems to fix their parkinson‚Äôs.  don‚Äôt know why, don‚Äôt know how, but hey it works, so lets see if we can figure anything out from that.    sure, you make electrodes smaller and put in more processing power and you can get a bit better idea of how stuff works.  but after that, we still aren‚Äôt entirely sure how to even approach the problem of quantifying subjective thoughts and feelings (ethically, at least).  and even if we did, it would take as long as the far easier job of mapping out the surface of the motor cortex did, at a minimum.  we‚Äôve built a boat that can traverse the atlantic, but there‚Äôs still a lot to figure out before that mars colony is founded.    **3)  qualia**  describe the color red to a person that is red-green colorblind.  describe the color red to a blind person.  is your ‚Äúred‚Äù even the same as my ‚Äúred‚Äù?  maybe more research can dig into this problem and come up with a solution.  however, this has been a concern since neuroscience began decades ago and has been almost entirely pushed aside for the philosophers to debate.  it is vital to figure these questions out before any brain-brain interface could function in any sense, but there is no sign of it being solved within the next 3 years.  not even sure of how much research is being done in this area.    **4)  immune response**  you implant something into a human, the immune system will go after it.  over a few years, your electrodes are going to be partially dissolved and encapsulated in a layer of scar tissue that messes with your em field recordings and emissions.    **5)  curveballs and crazy shit**  the cerebrum, in general terms, controls thought, memory, and voluntary motor function and if it is damaged (aka strokes, etc) those functions are impaired.  so if you completely get rid of the cerebrum of a person, they should be completely non-functional, right?  [nope!]( http://www.sciencealert.com/a-man-who-lives-without-90-of-his-brain-is-challenging-our-understanding-of-consciousness)  well, how about the cerebellum, which is supposed to coordinate all of our autonomous functions and again where damage has been shown to impair those actions?  getting rid of that completely should be almost a guaranteed death sentence.  [wrong again!]( https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329861-900-woman-of-24-found-to-have-no-cerebellum-in-her-brain/)  so we have years and years of research into figuring out what the brain does and how all of the bits and pieces work, and then one of these jerks come along to remind us that its all garbage and we still have no idea what we‚Äôre doing.  we‚Äôll make some progress in 5 years, but we aren‚Äôt going to completely solve the issue by then.    **6)  expense**  how much does cutting-edge tech cost?  a boat-load.  how much does medical-grade cutting-edge tech cost?  a boat-load^2 .  revolutionary, high tech equipment doesn‚Äôt really jive with a commercially viable product especially on a 5-year timescale.  plus, you are implanting it into the brain.  disabled people at least have the ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù of insurance/medicare going to bat for them.  for the rest of us, i don‚Äôt think paying for elective brain surgery out of pocket is going to be an option.

502081,"i'd like to point out that it's not really the hearing vs hearing-impaired/deaf issue you're making it out to be with employers. it's  employers vs employees with disabilities. hearing issues are far from the only disability that discourages some employers  from hiring people. the blind, mentally handicapped, wheelchair-bound, dwarves, etc. also face similar employment discrimination (i'd be surprised if deafness wasn't one of the more employable disablities, actually). it's certainly not fair (nor is having an impairment in the first place), but it's not bigotry.  just being realistic, there are a number of issues that come with employing a deaf person and whether they don't know how to accommodate them, don't want to apply resources to accommodate them, don't want the hassle of making special arrangements to accommodate them or they fear safety/legal issues if they fail to properly accommodate them, any of those things may make a non-disabled/non-hearing impaired candidate of similar ranking more attractive to them. it's not compassionate or caring (something sorely missing in today's job market), but that's the reality.",1,,-1

172116,"yeah, i've seen this. in my opinion/experience it *generally* goes physical disability, then social/behavioral (ie the autism spectrum), then mental/intellectual. however, a high functioning autistic person might be ""above"" a person who is paralyze from the neck down. it's like how a independently functioning amputee might look down on someone with severe down syndrome.     in my experience, i've always been near the top. i have cerebral palsy, i use a wheelchair outside my home and my speech can be difficult to understand at times, but i'm an independently living university student (i have a car and live on my own). growing up in physical therapy, i was always one of the ""cool kids"" along with another girl with cp similar to me and a girl with spina bifida. as horrible as it sounds, we were a bit ""cliquie"" because we were ""not as disabled"" as the other kids. this extended over to my high school days. even though i took the ""short bus"" (because of my wheelchair), i didn't really associate with any of the other kids, save for one. he had autism and we got along, however, we hated being 'lumped in with' the mentally disabled kids because we were both quite intelligent.   i think, for me, it stems from the fear and the hatred of being assumed that i am mentally disabled, when in reality, i'm very smart. i'm a prideful person and i'm proud of my intelligence.   the ""system"" probably doesn't help much either. for example, the disability services at my university often gets swamped during exam-week simply because there are not enough readers, scribes, or individual test rooms. so some students, such as myself and my blind friend, get priority over students with dyslexia or other learning disorders. you may argue that this is because ""we are more disabled"" (because that is part of it), but it's also because there is no way i could pass an exam without a scribe. but with a scribe, i can ace it.     as for conflicts between those disabled since birth (or a very young age) vs a disability acquired later, i haven't seen/experienced this much, but i can see how there could be issues. on one hand a disability acquired later means that a person got to experience ""normal life"" then had to adapt to becoming disabled. but those (like me) who have been disabled since birth have never had to ""learn to be disabled""; our challenges, and how to deal with them, have been engrained with us our entire lives. does that make me a better, ""more adaptive"" disabled person than the guy who was paralyzed at 25? no, but i would like to think so since he got 25 years of being normal.   is this all very petty? yes, but it happens.",1,,-1

967936,"full text:  call it the ten boxes conundrum.  she's been with her husband for years. she loves him. he ticks all the boxes, so to speak.  or, at least, he did. but lately, she's found herself wanting more. looking for more. keeping an eye out for big ticks in at least two squares he used to fill. keeping an eye on other men.  earlier this year christmas, she thought she had found it - someone who had the missing goods. she met a man who was more than capable of filling those empty boxes. he made her body feel electric again. he excited her mind and appetite.  she began seeing him. it was just for coffees at first. every time, she told herself it was innocent.  all she was doing was seeing him, drinking coffee, and indulging in nothing more than the delicious filling sensation their time together left her with. yes, there was sexual desire, but no sex. she knew she was using him as a patch. and she always told her husband where she was going and with whom.  what harm was she doing, really? better to be a bit with him and mostly with her husband, than not with her husband at all. or better than being with her husband, but hating him for not measuring up.  she needed that little bit extra. it satisfied her. it completed the list. what could be the harm in that? she figured she was safe. she figured it would be ok.  except, of course, it wasn't.  the more she saw of her two-box bloke, the more she wanted. she realised a mere pencil mark would not do ‚Äì she needed more than just a stopgap. this new man had exactly what she was looking for and she couldn't deny herself the satisfaction any longer.  why should she? she thought. you shouldn't settle for less than perfect. eight out of ten wasn't good enough.  she began to recalculate.  did her husband really measure up? perhaps he fell shorter of the mark than she initially thought. and perhaps the new man had more to offer than she had let herself see.  ""we're always told to reevaluate our jobs, why aren't we encouraged to reevaluate our relationships,"" she asked.  ""when you're not happy, you write a list. if it doesn't stack up, you make a decision. is it wrong to expect 100 per cent from everything?""  it's probably the most natural thing in the world, i replied. we want the best. we crave perfection. we wish everything could be just the way we desire.  except the beauty of life lies in imperfection ‚Äì having it all is not only impossible, it's ugly.  ""i don't think you should leave your husband because he doesn't tick all the boxes,"" i said.  ""but i do think you should strive to make your lives together the best they can be.""  she didn't seem satisfied with my response.  i thought about it. was i right? is it wrong to want it all, and expect to get it?  i've written a lot about great expectations, and the problem of unrealistic goals. i've also written about the scourge of settling ‚Äì when people cop out, and live with crap as a consequence.  in the end, it has to be about balance, surely. somewhere between everything, and nothing, is just right. determining what's just right, for you, is key.  just before christmas, my girlfriend came back to me. she had a confession to make. she had determined she was unhappy in her relationship to the point where she felt she had to leave it. she met two-box bloke for coffee with the intention of taking it further. she wanted to see whether he might, in fact, have more to offer.  but as her lips drew closer to his, and as she felt his breath on her neck, she thought about all the teary, late-night conversations she'd been having with her husband. the nights they'd spent lately, wrangling with the obvious truth of her unhappiness. she thought about his tenderness, his kindness, their history, and his understanding.  all these thoughts were swimming through her head as she moved into this other man's embrace. at once, she was overcome with emotion ‚Äì regret, sorrow, guilt, and, most importantly, love. love for the man she realised gave her so much more than anyone else ever could.  she pulled away. she looked at the other lover. she saw, for the first time, how little he really had. what had seemed like so much was actually nothing. it had seemed like more because it was missing, and all she could focus on was that small absence. she didn't see everything else was full.  ""i don't need all ten boxes ticked,"" she said. ""nine will do.""  nine?  she laughed. remembering how much she loved him had pleasant, physical consequences.  i was happy for her.  but i'm still not sure ‚Äì if you've signed up to forever, will anything less than everything do?",0,,

491011,"allow me to correct you. food stamps were created primarily to feed children and the disabled. and at that, they were to feed children of people who were *unable* to feed themselves. there is a cavernous gap between this and believing that they were intended for people who wanted to pursue other activities in lieu of supporting themselves.   i am all for reducing unnecessary spending in all variety of arenas. i discuss this one today as a response to a proposition that tax money should be spent to keep a healthy young person from working hard. i am not against a college kid receiving food stamps. if he is blind, crippled, or otherwise disabled, sure.   i am a charitable person, to those in need of charity. you're advocating something else. this requirement involves real struggle, disability, catastrophe, or inherent incapacity. none of these are present in the premise here. this is a healthy, unencumbered young person who doesn't want to work hard enough to get what he wants. as with any other such person, he is under no obligation to do so. but the price that comes with being unwilling to work that hard is not getting what you want. do you honestly object to able-bodied people having to earn what they get? is that your underlying objection to my argument?  i didn't say anyone was subhuman. i agreed that it is an effective deterrent to unnecessary acceptance of charity if there is a sense of shame and a feeling of degradation associated with receiving it. i myself may be so unfortunate as to require help feeding my children someday, there is always room for bad fortune. and if such a tragedy should come my way, i will be completely devastated and humiliated to have to walk down that road to feed my kids. and it is exactly that feeling of shame which will guarantee that i will do everything that i can to return to self-sufficiency with the greatest of haste. it's not about judging anyone, it's about a cultural practice which minimizes dependence and maximizes the number of positive contributors the public domain.  you are creating a false image of who i am as a person because of my philosophy on stable government and sound fiscal policy. government can not, and should not, try to be too many things to too many people. i believe strongly in compassion for those in need. but the key element here is *need*.",1,,0

274754,"sorry it's taken me a while to get to this. it's an extremely complex topic, and has a lot of variables. the nature of the disability itself was a big one.  the first thing to remember is that medieval people would likely have been *very aware* of disability, and it would have been very visible in their world. plenty of things that modern medicine considers treatable/preventable would have been much more serious and much more permanent until quite recently. a woman in the village who'd had measles as a girl and gone blind, which is obviously so much rarer in developed countries now. the man who'd had a really complex broken bone because he fell off a roof, then had it heal less than perfectly so he walked with a limp for the rest of his life; we'd do surgery to put pins and plates in there that could hold everything straight and true while it healed, but they couldn't. the groom or stablehand kicked in the head by a horse, who used to be able to speak so eloquently but who struggled (or had even been mute) since his injury; to modern eyes that's clearly a tbi, but to them young walter's just a bit...simple now, still a good hand with the horses but you'll have to explain everything twice. the gradual breakdown that comes with age anyway, no matter what anyone does to prevent it.  certainly in the realm of ""acquired"" disability, they knew and were very familiar with it, and seemingly would usually keep that person integrated into the community if they were able to do so. however, this familiarity means that it's not consistently documented. what's the most important distinguishing feature of john thatch? that he is a thatcher, and thus has a vital skill...or that he once fell off a roof and limps a bit because the break healed a bit wrong and his left leg's an inch shorter than his right? looking at physical remains that we dig up from graves shows a lot of sometimes very obvious wear and tear, but written or visual records to confirm can be lacking.  you'll *sometimes* get hints in the names (especially higher status names....there was a king john of bohemia who lost his sight in his forties due to ophthalmia, but managed to convince almost everyone that he was totally fine for the next ten years and eventually died in battle at crecy, which he fought *while totally blind*; the men of his personal guard all knew he couldn't see a damn thing, and tied the reins of their horses together to his so they wouldn't lose him) that someone was clearly disabled, but it's not always present, and the nature of the records themselves mean that the story is very often incomplete. these records do get a lot better in the later years.  disabilities that you were born with (like tyrion, or like me) are a bit different, because *that's* where you get into sin and blame.   [behold, the sexiest and most sinful thing you'll see all week](http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/flowchart2.png)  sin is *fundamental* to medieval catholicism, and it was by far the easiest explanation to reach for when a child was born who was so obviously...not quite right. a situation like tyrion's would usually be blamed on something the mother or father had done - sex on a holy day? you're gonna have a monster baby...or possibly twins, which unfortunately for tywin also fascinate many medieval (mostly monks and thus mostly celibate, which means they were slightly obsessed about the topic!) sex writers as a sign of wantonness - or because the stars were fucked up, rather than on tyrion himself, who would initially be in some ways thought of as being given a special challenge to draw him closer to god. in suffering on earth, tyrion won't have to do it after death and will get to heaven sooner. he might be ridiculed for it - there are lots of records of things which seem to us very unkind - but as long as he could fulfil some role in the community he probably wouldn't be *hated* for it, and kindness to him would make everyone else look good. where people with inborn disabilities appear, they're often doing either very simple work (like looking after livestock) or very complex, precise work like saddlery. i think tyrion would make a good saddler, don't you?  many of the first dedicated support services for people with disabilities are in this kind of religious framework, built into the community; almshouses often tended to the old and infirm, and bethlem royal hospital in london (which was not originally a mental institution, but more sort of generalist almshouse) dates back to 1247.  there would likely be some complications attached to being tyrion, all the same. he would not usually be permitted to take up holy orders (an acquired disability was fine, an inborn one was not) and in some jurisdictions may not be able to fully inherit, though it would be on his family to care for him. this, for instance, is the law in parts of mid-1200s germany  &gt; neither tenancy nor hereditary property can devolve among the feebleminded, dwarfs or cripples. the actual heirs and their next of kin are responsible for their care  by the mid 1300s, the law is more precise, much more strict and *may* exclude elderly but otherwise fine men too  &gt; a  man  may  transfer  all  movable  property  without  consent  of  the  heirs  as  long  as  he  can  climb  on  a  horse  by  himself,  with  sword  buckled  on and  shield  in  hand,  using  a  wooden  block  or  stone  an  ell  high  without  help from  anyone  except  the  person  who  holds  the horse  and  stirrup  for  him. if  he   cannot  execute  this,  he  may  not  give  away  movable property  nor  transfer  nor  lend  it  in  order  to  deprive  the  person  who  has claim to it upon his death.  over time, it gets more and more complicated (as *canon* law is also growing more complex, secular law follows...and as judicially sanctioned maiming becomes more accepted and codified in secular law, so too does the definition of different terms - ""lame"" vs ""crippled"", for instance - become less vague) and the amount of wriggle room the disabled person themselves has to do things grows less and less.  westeros, weirdly, has almost none of this. the only thing that stops tyrion's inheritance (at least, before he confesses to regicide) is tywin being a dick.",1,,2

""legally blind"" means not blind. ""my son has a disability"" often means he is ill-disciplined. an electric wheelchair is often an enabler of laziness.  what is insensitive is referring to the thing that makes someone different. just act natural. if they insist on referring to their own disability, just move on.",1,,-1
592430,"so in contrast to a lot of top comments on this thread, i'm also not comfortable with this use. it reminds me very strongly of language use changes from when i worked in disability services. we were told in no uncertain terms that we should discuss 'people with disabilities' rather than 'the disabled' or the very archaic 'cripples' because those terms were subtly or outright dehumanizing and reduced the people concerned to their condition.  similarly 'people with autism' as opposed to 'autistics', 'sight/hearing impaired people' as opposed to 'the blind, the deaf'.  ultimately it is just another appeal to tribalism and putting people into a box so it's harder to connect emotionally to them, even if that isn't necessarily the directly intended consquence. as i don't feel calling people 'illegals' is any more helpful than 'cripples', i can only be a little wary of why this usage is being brought in and normalized after what's (at least in my profession) been a long sustained period of trying to move away from using such terms for groups of people.",1,,0

696483,"it seems like this one might depend on area a lot. i'm from the uk and it really just doesn't exist here. but in the us it seems that's often the official term used for things like disabled parking.   still i would default to disabled. i don't think i've ever heard from anybody who objects to that term and even when handicapped is also a recognised term i believe disabled usually is as well. and i don't think everybody in the us necessarily likes the term handicapped, it's just what's used for a log of stuff.   and if you're in the uk disabled is pretty much the only appropriate term.    while i'm here i'll also quickly mention a few of the commonly asked about/ questionable terms and actions just cos.    ....person first language (""person with a disability"" vs ""disabled person""). in general nobody cares. it's not a necessary step to make. it's totally fine to say disabled person. if you happen to be around somebody who does care just try to use person first around them. that then varies when it comes to specific conditions but honestly it's usually just the one that sounds better. ""cancer person"" sounds wrong. ""person with cancer"" sounds right.   ...as far as i'm aware ""autistic person"" tends to be the preferred term. along with ""deaf person"", ""blind person"", ""nonverbal person"" (not dumb or, as far as i know, mute). you'll honestly probably be able to sense which feels better and hopefully if you get it ""wrong"" somebody will just say it the ""right"" way and you can pick up on it. i'd does also come down to preference though so you're never guaranteed to get it right and that's fine. just follow the lead of other people if you aren't sure, especially if they are a disabled person/ have that condition.   ....in general try to avoid terms that add an extra detail like ""cancer sufferer"" ""diabetes warrior"" etc. not everybody likes those terms. try to stick to just the basics rather than adding some extra flare. with terms like that you're automatically adding that they suffer or that they are at war with their condition/ should be fighting. those details can matter for some people. and for others it can just sounds kinda silly.   ....wheelchair user is the preferred term for basically anybody i've heard from. try to avoid ""wheelchair bound"". it's commonly used, but a lot of wheelchair users aren't fans cos like above it adds and extra flare and an extra detail. you're saying that they aren't just using a wheelchair, they are totally glued to it and unable to leave.   ... mobility issues is a good one for anybody who can't move well. it gets a bit more specific without talking directly about their condition (and needing to find the best way to describe their condition which you might not even know).   ...chronic illness/ chronically ill tends to be a good term for people who are sick/ i'll long term but might not consider themselves disabled/ for further context beyond disabled.   ...neurological condition, neurodivegent etc tends to be the preferred term for ""special needs"". sounds less condascending. not everybody knows about that though and a lot still use special needs.  ...for the absence of disability, a condition etc you're usually safe with ""non- xyz"" or ""person without"". non disabled person. person without cancer. able bodied is also fine for talking about non-disabled people.   ... for accomodations, facilities etc you can usually use ""disabled"" or ""accessible"". accessible entrance, disabled parking etc etc. that really just comes down to preference. personally i tend to lean more towards ""accessible"" because often those resources can benefit other people who aren't necessarily disabled too. and personally i just feel like it sounds better cos otherwise it sounds like the door has it's own disability. that's totally just preference though.   .... it's absolutely okay to offer help. just don't push. ""hey would you like a hand with anything?"" ""nah i'm good"" ""okay no problem"". simple. always ask! never just grab somebody or their mobility aid, never just jump in and start doing stuff unless it's very clearly an absolute emergency. otherwise it's like picking up a random old lady and walking her across the road. stupid.    ... and last thing... disability is more than just what you can claim benefits for. some people think the benefits criteria is what decides if somebody is disabled. that's not the case. that idea can stop disabled people seeking support, can make able bodied people think somebody is faking and can generally just be confusing. exact wording varies by area but in general anybody with long term symptoms that have a negative impact on their ability to do day to day stuff (anything that's just seen as a part of life) can identify as disabled. it's a personal choice of an individual does, but weather they personally identify that way or not they are protected by the relevant rights in that country/ area. in the uk it's the equality act. in america it's the ada (americans with disabilities act). it's not up to you or anybody else to decide if somebody else is disabled or has the right to be using disabled accommodations.   you will never be able to know everything about disability. there's way way too much. way too many conditions and each of them vary from person to person. that's totally fine. you don't need to know everything, just be open to learning when it comes up and remember that you don't know everything. the biggest problem you can cause is usually by acting like you know everything. like people who accuse blind people of faking because they don't have grey eyes (just cos uncle garry does doesn't mean every blind person does).",1,,0

893693,"as to those souls who are born into this life as ethereal and radiant entities and yet, on account of their handicaps and trials, are deprived of great and real advantages, and leave the world without having lived to the full‚Äîcertainly this is a cause for grieving. this is the reason why the universal manifestations of god unveil their countenances to man, and endure every calamity and sore affliction, and lay down their lives as a ransom; it is to make these very people, the ready ones, the ones who have capacity, to become dawning points of light, and to bestow upon them the life that fadeth never. this is the true sacrifice: the offering of oneself, even as did christ, as a ransom for the life of the world. (‚Äòabdu‚Äôl-bah√°, selections from the writings of ‚Äòabdu‚Äôl-bah√°, p. 64-65)   even though we find a defective branch or leaf upon this tree of humanity or an imperfect blossom, it, nevertheless, belongs to this tree and not to another. therefore, it is our duty to protect and cultivate this tree until it reaches perfection. if we examine its fruit and find it imperfect, we must strive to make it perfect. there are souls in the human world who are ignorant; we must make them knowing. some growing upon the tree are weak and ailing; we must assist them toward health and recovery. if they are as infants in development, we must minister to them until they attain maturity. we should never detest and shun them as objectionable and unworthy. we must treat them with honor, respect and kindness; for god has created them and not satan. they are not manifestations of the wrath of god but evidences of his divine favor. god, the creator, has endowed them with physical, mental and spiritual qualities that they may seek to know and do his will; therefore, they are not objects of his wrath and condemnation. in brief, all humanity must be looked upon with love, kindness and respect; for what we behold in them are none other than the signs and traces of god himself. all are evidences of god; therefore, how shall we be justified in debasing and belittling them, uttering anathema and preventing them from drawing near unto his mercy? this is ignorance and injustice, displeasing to god; for in his sight all are his servants. (‚Äòabdu‚Äôl-bah√°, the promulgation of universal peace, p. 230-231)   that there should be, however, certain individuals, who, by reason of some serious deficiency, physical or mental, would be incapacitated to contract marriage and enjoy the blessings of an enduring and successful marital life, is only too evident, but these constitute only a very small section of humanity, and are therefore merely an exception, and their condition cannot possibly invalidate what an allwise and loving providence has decreed to be the normal way to a fruitful and constructive social existence. the exact conditions and circumstances under which such incapacitated individuals should be advised or even prevented perhaps from entering into any sort of marital existence have not been specified in the bah√°‚Äô√≠ writings, but will have to be defined later on by the universal house of justice. in the meantime, those believers who consider themselves as falling into the above category would do well, before taking any final decision themselves, to consult medical experts, who are both conscientious and competent, and to abide by their recommendation. (shoghi effendi, some aspects of health, healing, nutrition and related matters)    the beloved guardian has asked me to assure you and the parents of the dear baby of his prayers for his healing, both material and spiritual. it is difficult for us to understand these calamities when they come to us. those who are firm in the faith, know that the hand of god protects them, and if something of this nature comes upon them, it is for some reason, which may have to do with the spiritual development of the one affected, or the spiritual development and welfare of the loved ones; or even for the melting of the hearts of non-bah√°‚Äô√≠s, who will be affected by the divine spirit, through the manner in which the bah√°‚Äô√≠ meets such an ordeal. (shoghi effendi, lights of guidance, p. 281)   the body of man becomes lean or fat; it is afflicted with disease, suffers mutilation; perhaps the eyes become blind, the ears deaf; but none of these imperfections and failings afflict or affect the spirit. the spirit of man remains in the same condition, unchanged. a man is blinded, but his spirit continues the same. he loses his hearing, his hand is cut off, his foot amputated; but his spirit remains the same. he becomes lethargic, he is afflicted with apoplexy; but there is no difference, change or alteration in his spirit. this is proof that death is only destruction of the body, while the spirit remains immortal, eternal. (‚Äòabdu‚Äôl-bah√°, the promulgation of universal peace, p. 306)   the handicapped person, seemingly incapable of taking part in consultation, may in fact be able to function quite adequately, provided his fellow assembly members are determined to find ways in which they can help him to participate. (universal house of justice to a national spiritual assembly, 15 january 1965)  the prejudice and discrimination that disabled people suffer is the product of the more general human tendency to label as ‚Äúinferior‚Äù those who are somehow different. but the ostracism that disabled persons often experience can be even more intense, for it is founded on fear‚Äîfear on the part of the ostracizer that he, too, may someday become the victim of disability. the only way to eradicate this fear is to educate every member of society to see disability for what it really is‚Äîa mental or physical condition that may make everyday life more challenging, but that cannot affect the disabled person‚Äôs soul, spirit, creativity, imagination or determination‚Äîin short, some of the most valuable aspects of life. at the same time, such an appreciation will enable individuals to see through the outward handicaps of disabled persons, to their inner reality. (bah√°‚Äô√≠ international community, 1988 aug 06, human rights disability)  there is no explicit guidance in the writings regarding birth defects and the universal house of justice has not ruled on the issue of an operation in the case of a life-threatening birth defect. it is therefore left to the judgment of the parents or guardians who must carefully and prayerfully weigh whatever medical advice they receive in light of the general guidance given in the bah√°‚Äô√≠ teachings, balanced with the needs of all members of the family and how any decision would affect them. the assembly should support whatever decision is made by the parents or guardians without trying to influence it, on the understanding that in such difficult situations there is neither a right nor a wrong answer and it is the parties themselves who must live with any decision made. (usa- nsa, guidelines for local spiritual assemblies, chapter 14, p. 5)  [w]e would ... emphasize the ideal of rehabilitation within the family as well as in the community. family members should be trained, where possible, to help provide the support and encouragement that the disabled person requires to surmount his impairment.

351269,"your reality is a bit off - i have no idea how you think your ""statistics"" are accurate, or even more than just your personal (obviously flash-hating) biased opinion.  clear my schedule, there is too much horseshit in this post for me to concentrate on anything else.  &gt; consider how quickly webkit is being developed.  consider how quickly it's not being integrated consistently and supported by major browsers as quickly as flash player has.  webkit's success relies on every major browser quickly updating and supporting features correctly.  adobe relies on adobe.  &gt; this has made the security, and hardware access of flash a problem the vendors can't solve, and adobe is too slow to solve.  exactly what security issues have been a huge problem?  this is another argument you fanboys always throw out, but there is no substantial reasoning behind it - because there is no issue.  abobe updates the player immediately after any security issues are found, just like ms does with windows, and every other software manufacturer does.  there are no open holes in flash (do some research), and even during the tiny windows of opportunity between 0-day and patch, there were no huge malware/virus/worm/trojan releases that used flash.  if you actually knew anything about flash security - you would know that flash's extremely limited security sandbox is so confining that it's even frustrating for everyday development work.  javascript has helped install more viruses and popped up more windows/redirects and caused more security issues and basic user rage than flash could dream of.   &gt; i prefer standard organisations that just 'stamp a standard'.  you missed my point entirely.  yes, i agree it's better to have community input on the standard - but then you have to wait 10, 15 years for it to be fully implemented.  flash updates about every other year.  the reason flash ever took off in the first place was exactly because the internet is not going to sit and wait for the 'community' to get the fuck in gear and make it happen.  &gt; hello, reality check. 90% of the tablets out there don't support flash.  completely false.  i can tell you right now without even checking that this is complete bullshit, because android supports flash, and it has over 20% alone.  &gt; the other doesn't support any of the complicated stuff of flash; the performance simply doesn't keep up.  exactly.  this is not a flash problem.  it's up to the developers to find the happy medium, just like in any other programming language, in any other software, in any other technology.  build for the lowest common denominator.  this is not a new concept.  &gt; windows 8 is not going to support flash in any way, in their default new user-interface targetted at end-consumers.  once again, completely false because of the way you worded it to make it seem like it's not offering flash at all.  windows 8 will offer ""metro mode"" - a touch-screen styled os gui that will not have flash.  using the default classic-style ""start menu"" os option will allow flash.  &gt; so, why is reality proving you wrong?   um... it isn't.  flash is 9000 miles ahead of what javascript can do.  &gt; i agree that in theory this should have been the case. but adobe dropped the ball. it is too late now.  you keep reiterating that ""it's over, flash is dead, adobe lost"", although i have yet to see where any of this is validated in reality.  yes, flash's role has been replaced in some areas, which was bound to happen when the rest of the web technology catches up slowly.  do you have a date on when this happened?  was there an announcement by adobe?  i haven't seen any major flash dev communities shut down yet.    &gt; and the big bucks (google, microsoft, apple), are spending way more, and moving way faster than flash is.  spending way more on what?  google chrome integrates flash.  apple is moving in a different direction because flash threatens app store profits on games.  microsoft is trying to steal the ios idea for windows 8.  this has nothing to do with anything.  &gt; you act like the little area of rendering animations is 99% of the challenge. it is not. it is bandwidth, it is hosting, it's power usage.   the bandwidth has nothing to do with the fact that it's flash or not - it's how much content the technology is using. as far as power is concerned - rendering the screen at 30fps does take a bit more power than static html.  &gt; flash isn't capable of running on the devices they are now mass producing.   bullshit.  this is a complete and total lie.  it runs on android-based tablets and smartphones, and it runs on rooted idevices.  &gt; money-wise, flash isn't very interesting to support anymore, and it is very interesting to just kill it for all the big vendors. (google, apple and ms)  your 'facts' are hilarious.  but what's really funny is that i just recently noticed when debugging a flash app in firefox (which i rarely use now) that every time it threw an error, firefox would freeze up and then flash would crash.  literally every time.  after spending a couple hours looking into the situation, i permanently disabled the ""plugin-controller"", the application that firefox uses to 'wrap' browser plugins to prevent the browser from crashing when the plugin does.  after i did that, everything was perfect.  my processor used less than half of the power than it did just an hour ago running the same applications, and it no longer froze up. if these companies would simply quit spending money trying to fix something that isn't broken, everything would be fine.  but instead, people like you blame it on adobe.  because, it is after all, the preferred political opinion to have these days. too bad it's completely misinformed hype that has no basis in reality.   &gt; that 99% of all use cases of the internet do not require flash, but they do require that they can cross-device, including mobile device, that are low powered.  this statistic is once again either made up or exaggerated.  most sites don't require flash - they offer it.  if you knew anything about flash development, or even website development in general, mobile-specific sites are developed along side the normal build, and ios/android etc are redirected to the mobile version.  this once again, has nothing to do with flash - it has to do with web content no matter the technology.  &gt; windows 8 will be the same for tablets as desktops. both sporting a web-first, app-store first, touch interface. 90% of the consumers will buy a tablet, or laptop, that isn't running a x68 chip.  source?  i'm assuming you mean x86 - but again, this is all complete speculation, not fact.  &gt; the black box is a problem, not the fact that the api would be controlled by adobe, but that device builders and os builders they can't properly schedule flash.   not sure what you mean by ""schedule"", but all they have to do is allow the plugin.  anything else they do (i.e. firefox's ""plugin-controller"") just causes issues.  &gt; they can't mute a flash radio station, because your are getting a skype call.   why not?  do you know how to click a button?  what do you do when you are playing ""call of duty"" and get a call?  does it mute for you?  wtf?  &gt; they can't have a working screen-reader for blind people.  [http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/flash/author.html](wrong.)  i built one 5 months ago.   &gt; but there is no money in games in flash.   true, if you develop them for ios.  otherwise, complete bullshit.  &gt; there is money in native apps, with proper drm and app-stores that make it easy to charge the credit-card of the user.  only an option, not the rule.  and flash is the only drm support available right now for video on the web.  just thought you'd want to know.  before you downvote - do some fucking research and learn the truth - and this is just a shitload of blown-out hype that gets repeated regularly by fanboys and the completely uninformed.  &gt; you have trouble accepting reality.  i have trouble accepting your 'reality'.  your 'reality' is not based on any solid fact - only rumor, speculation, and completely bullshit statements.  the actual reality, not giving a shit if it's 'politically correct or not' is simple:     a. certain features of flash can now be replicated by html5.     b. flash's role is changing.     c. flash is not, by default, installed on certain non-rooted tablets and smartphones.    d. it is not dying, and never was.    if you are naive and irrational enough to deny these simple truths, and realize that everything outside of these simple truths is complete speculation, rumor, or flat out lie, then i'm afraid your vision of reality is in need of some work.  end of story.",0,,

437675,"*(continued because i ran out of room)*  my 3 mcs were my best friends in my childhood. my daydreaming daily stories about them, was a replacement for the real friends i was not allowed to have. in adulthood after i had learned to read and write, these 3 became the 3 main characters i wrote about. fifty years later, i still write about them and they are to this day still my three best friends. that is why i write them. i write to have someone to spend time with, because i am either too light or too dark for any real people to consider me worthy of spending time with. that has not changed. i still have no friends to this day, and the reason they give is always the same: i'm too light for any black person to associate with me and i am too dark for any white person to associate with me.  and so i write 3 non-white mcs, who are mixed like me, and are friends with each other, because, like me, no white or black character will give them the time of day.  that is not me writing ""representation"". that is me writing wish fulfillment. wishing that there were more people like myself in the world, so that there would someday, one day, finally be a single, solitary human being who would just sit down and talk to me, join me for a meal, and not say i'm not the right colour.  if i was to write ""representation"" i would write with the intent of making a political statement, intent of bringing about change. but i don't. i just wrote myself three fictional friends who i could spend time with, because we live in a world that bases friendships on skin colour, and me being a mixed race, i'm not the right skin colour for anyone.  my point is, you don't have to be focused on ""representation"" to include a none-white character.  in fact, i think ""representation"" is a really bad reason to include a non-white character, because it means the author is looking to start a fight, and don't we already have enough fighting over skin colour as it is?  diversity and inclusiveness are not words that are interchangeable with the word ""representation"" and i think every one on this thread, seems to have forgotten that.  &gt;&gt;&gt;the reader can assume whatever skin color they want.  but... you see... i would then look at how the setting is, and make assumptions based on that. and if the character is not being harassed, bullied, beaten, abused, and rocks thrown at them, i'm going to assume they are white.   i'm not white. i'm an elderly woman with a crippled leg, because when i was 8 months pregnant, 3 white people armed with golf clubs, snuck up behind me while i was putting bags in my car. i am legally blind from birth and legally deaf, so i neither heard nor saw them coming. they killed my baby, brock my spine, shattered my spinal column, broke my hips and knees and left me for dead. i was paralyzed for 5 months, then i was in a wheelchair, and it took me 18 months to progress to walking with a walker. it's been 9 years now and i am still struggling to walk on my own, now aided by a cane. but i'm not white, so no one cares.  this was not the first attack, nor was it the last.  a year earlier is a different store parking lot across town, an 80 year old black man was beaten to death with a shopping cart, by a gang of white teens.  two years ago, a black school teacher, my neighbour from 8 house down the road, was attacked by her 10 year old students.  where i live, these attacks are a daily thing all non-whites live with. and it's been like this for decades. it's not something new.  i don't know what it is like to be a coloured person and to not live in mortal terror of setting foot outside my home.  and because of this, i can not imagine, a non-abused, non-harassed character in a novel, as anything other then white.   and so, even though i am not white, i would in fact default to thinking the character was white, simply because their life experience is such a stark contrast to my life experience.  and for this reason, if an author wants me to think of the character's race as being the same as my own, well, the author must outright say the race of the character, describe the skin colour, and specify outright that this privaliged character who acts like a white person, is in fact not a white person.  &gt;&gt;&gt;i was told to avoid making my main character disabled unless ""it matters to the plot, like how a protagonist is basically only gay if it's an lgbt-centered book"". i want other thoughts on this...  &gt;&gt;&gt;my friend and i were having a debate, see.  &gt;&gt;&gt;because my main character has epilepsy, something that happened after a traumatic brain injury from the past. long story short, his older half-brother tried to kill him and his mother, was half-successful (killed mom) but failed to kill the mc. he survived, but with epilepsy.  &gt;&gt;&gt;however, my friend said this, essentially:  &gt;&gt;&gt;""you honestly shouldn't make your character disabled unless it matters to the plot in some way. otherwise people will either read too much into it or think it matters when it doesn't. kind of like how you shouldn't make your mc black or gay or whatever unless you're trying to make a political statement or if you're writing a specifically lgbt-centered book. it's all about markets and selling.""  &gt;&gt;&gt;now, of course it's not verbatim since we were talking for a while, but they were basically saying not to write...anyone, i guess? fucking, like, i guess i'm not supposed to write anyone because of ""markets"" or whatever. because my book isn't about disability or epilepsy. it's actually a fantasy book. it just so happens that the mc is epileptic. but they said, because of that, that i shouldn't have an epileptic mc since people will ""read too much into it"" or whatever...?  &gt;&gt;&gt;does anyone even get what my friend is saying?  &gt;&gt;&gt;i mean, fuck it, my mc is still gonna be epileptic and nobody can stop me, but my friend seemed dead-set determined to tell me i shouldn't since it's not, like, a central theme or thing or whatever. i don't know...  &gt;&gt;&gt;thoughts?  thoughts?  i have so many thoughts.  let's explore them.  i am not a plot device. neither are the characters i write.  my mc quaraun, walks with a cane because of a lame leg from an old injury (a sword through his hip), has joint pain that is probably arthritis, but arthritis hasn‚Äôt been discovered yet in his time period, is clearly autistic even though kanner‚Äôs syndrome won‚Äôt be discovered until the 1940s, has a learning disability that causes him to not be able to mentally process numbers/time/years/dates/math, he has obsessive-compulsive disorder; he has post-traumatic stress disorder, he sometimes can talk fine around close friends but struggles with selective mutism and extreme anxiety around strangers, punding is a serious problem and trips up his ability to do everyday things - like if he sees a field of flowers he is compelled to pick as many flowers as he can carry and he doesn‚Äôt know why he does it and it usually requires a friend to come along and pull him out of the flower field because he can‚Äôt stop on his own, he is prone to walk along railroad tracks with a bag picking up every grey rock that has a white quartz stripe in it and he has thousands of them around his house instead of having a front lawn due to do many years of doing this daily, and he is prone to walking for hours on end on ridge-top roof poles of the old abandoned factories and mill buildings along the saco river for no reason at all other than he feels a desperate need to be close to the clouds.  why?  not a shred of that has anything to do with the plot.  so why do i write him that way?  because:     *   i walk with a cane due to a lame leg from an old injury (a two foot long foundation nail/iron rod through my hip when i was 4 years old     *   i have joint pain that is probably arthritis     *   i have kanner‚Äôs syndrome aka actual autism, which is not on the autism spectrum (because only illness that are not autism are on the autism spectrum, which means the 861 illnesses that can be confused with but are not autism) and is in no way, shape, or form related to aspergers     *   i have a learning disability that causes me to not be able to mentally process numbers/time/years/dates/math     *   i have obsessive-compulsive disorder     *   i have post-traumatic stress disorder     *   i sometimes can talk fine around close friends but struggle with selective mutism and extreme anxiety around strangers      *   punding is a serious problem for me and trips up my ability to do everyday things - like when i see a field of flowers i am compelled to pick as many flowers as i can carry and i don‚Äôt know why i do it and it usually requires a friend to come along and pull me out of the flower field because i can‚Äôt stop picking flowers on my own     *   i am prone to walk along railroad tracks with a bag picking up every grey rock that has a white quartz stripe in it and i have thousands of them around my yard instead of having a front lawn due to doing this daily for over 50 years now - i started doing it as a toddler, the railroad tracks go right by my yard     *   i am prone to walking for hours on end on ridge-top roof poles of the old abandoned factories and mill buildings along the saco river for no reason at all other than i feel a desperate need to be close to the clouds  i am not a plot device; i didn‚Äôt choose to have those things. these things exist in my life, like it or not.  i write him having the same disabilities as me, because i know what it is like to live with these things. i know how these things trip up everyday activities, like how i can‚Äôt just open the door and walk outside because i get to the end of the driveway and go back to the door to check the lock, 10 or 20 times before i finally make it out of the driveway... and he does this door checking thing to, not because it has any meaning to the plot, but because, i don‚Äôt know how to write a person who does not do that.     *(continued because i ran out of room)*",1,,0

857974,"oh yeah i saw where you mentioned my username in that poor guy's thread about his having an ugly face.  judging by your response, it's sad to see that you still don't comprehend that a person's appearance absolutely defines how they are perceived in life.  do you honestly think people wake up one day and look in the mirror and think to themselves out of the blue, ""boy i'm ugly""?  the first impression you make on a stranger is the most important, lasting one.  not that this question has anything to do with the rest of my diatribe, but could you please explain to me why girls use make-up?  i'll wait.  i read all the time, ""it's okay to not be attracted to people that you don't find attractive"" on women subs and i wholeheartedly 110% agree!  by extension, i agree that each and every person's prejudices are there for a reason.  maybe the reason why i've never seen other short guys with one eye and hearing aids work a cash register, or stocking shelves, or taking my order at a restaurant, or in a relationship, is because people like me had been inefficient and costly and embarrassing and creepy in the past, so now it's better to be safe than sorry by not giving me a chance to prove myself as part of the socioeconomic marchine.  i've seen some ""ugly"" dudes on the other side of the counter, but since they aren't constantly going ""huh?  can you speak up?  can you repeat that? can you talk slower?  oh no my hearing aid battery's going out, wait a second"" while their blind eye involuntarily streams tears down their cheek, it's clear to see where the line for ""ugly"" is drawn.  never in all my trawling of social media have i found one picture of a little old disabled guy having a successful life, just news stories of deformed men like tyler ziegel or simon vaughn getting royally fucked over financially by their spouses alongside articles of mama june hooking up with her pedophile non-disabled boyfriend and pictures of bill and hillary still being together twenty years after he embarrassed the shit out of her with a national sex scandal.  i used to think that these stories are supposed to elicit outrage and prompt a morality change, but now i realize that they're just like regular consumable media like saved by the bell or cheers:  examples meant to be mimicked by their consumers.  zack morris's ugliest friend is a healthy normal non-disabled awkward fellow with a penchant for interracial relationships, and none of the patrons served by mayday malone were blind or deaf or in wheelchairs, and as long as you can walk upright and carry things for other people and speak clearly and hear whispered pillow talk and see fine print from clear across the room, it's okay to be a pedophile or an alcoholic or just plain ""weird"".  all i read in these stories now is, ""shhh, it's okay to leave your spouse when they become injured in the service so you can sue them for a better income, shhh, it's okay that pedophiles can have a stable romantic relationship, shhh, it's okay that women stay married to men who cheats on them, shhh, calm down, this is how life is supposed to be, you don't get rewards simply for being the default of a good person, and it's okay for shitbags to be rewarded as well, it doesn't matter what kind of a person you are on the inside, only how you look on the outside, so sshhh shhh shhhh, go to eternal sleep.""

 high-five, hopefully he [deleted] his life next, haha!!  and you know what?  it's okay and i respect you for that. this is just simply perfectly normal everyday social conditioning to weed the chaff from the wheat that i've been talking about all the time.  sincerely, like i said on that blind dude's gofundme, the world is overpopulated and there's too much competition for limited social slots.  we can't reboot aktion t4 and kill people who are unable to work, because people would just love to have a reason to pretend to be outraged (but secretly deep down they were enjoying it, which was why facebook left that one live video of that autistic being tortured by those four beautiful non-disabled people up for over a half hour despite being spammed with reports), so now we have to take a softer approach:  with words and a gentler touch.  just like my first day in sixth grade and i tried to sit with some of my playground friends from grade school and one of the girls said, ""maybe you should sit with your own kind...over there,"" pointing to the special needs table despite the fact that i had been taking the normal classes.  definitely because of the way i acted and the things i did and you obviously know me better than i do, and absolutely not because of my ugly retarded face.  look, i get it.  you can't say, ""you're a lost cause and shouldn't have been conceived, please kill yourself and get out of the way and let us have more room to breathe.""  you just kind of have to...gently beat around the bush about it with little hints and actions and hope that we read between the lines so you can remain safely free of culpability when we do eventually kill ourselves.  i've taken the hint long ago, maybe ugly face dude will too, and you can freely leave the house and go shopping and hang with your friends and drink coffee at starbucks and get drinks at the bar while thinking to yourself in the back of your head, ""that's two down!"" and you can feel a little bit more safe and comfortable from creepy little ugly men.  dunno why you're so fascinated with me, but i do sincerely apologize for the time you've wasted in reading over all of my dribble.",1,,-2

513745,"&gt;""are these appropriately called ""disabilities"" or would it be more appropriate to call them medical issues that manifest in ways that disable you?""  oh! i found the quotation feature!  these are considered disabilities under the ada.  there's a lot of stigma around the word disability and people just want to avoid using it unless it fits their notion of the concept.  but there's a huge movement among people with disabilities to use the word disability and no euphemisms.  if a condition manifest in ways that disable someone it's a disability.    again, if you want i can copy/paste the definition of disability according to the ada.  in essence it's any significant limitation on major life activities.    &amp;#x200b;  &gt;for example, someone with a stoma has a medical condition that prevents them living life in the same way as ""normal"" people, but i don't know if it's appropriate to suggest that they are disabled in the colloquial sense of the word.  i don't know what a stoma is.  ""normal"" people are called ""abled"", ""non-disabled"", or ""temporarily non-disable"" people.  if this stoma significantly limits major life activities then it's a disability.  if it effects a major bodily or mental functions then it's a disability.  if it's a disfigurement or signficant abnormality then it's disability.  all these things are covered under the ada.    for example, if someone has a facial disfigurement, they are still covered under the ada for discrimination.  if someone says, we don't like the way your face looks so we won't hire you or serve you, etc.  they are covered even if the disfigurement doesn't significantly limit a major life activity.  the reason for this is there used to be ""ugly"" laws and people with disfigurements could be institutionalize, fined or punished previously.   &gt;quite possible, but i have no idea given that you won't elaborate on what your disabilities are beyond legal blindness in one eye.   dshs, oah and their contractors have agreed i'm disabled.  i qualify for home &amp; community services (caregivers), you cannot qualify for those if you aren't disabled.  i qualified for ""aged, blind, and disabled"" services.     again, you can only get those if you are disabled.    no one involved is questioning my status as a disabled person.   &gt;that may be the case. it is just jarring to hear someone who is ""mentally disabled"" to the extent that they can collect benefits is perfectly capable of engaging with someone in a longford internet debate and not come across as very impaired at all.  it's called masking.  a lot of disabled people mask because there's so much stigma, prejudice and discrimination with disability.  i cannot perform to this level at all times.    &amp;#x200b;  &gt;being an advocate and correctly relating legal concepts are not the same thing.  my advocacy relied heavily on legal concepts.  people used to tell me i should become a lawyer.  i would have gone back to school for law but i couldn't take on anymore student debt.    i've done court support, lobbied my elected officials, etc and it's sometimes important to use the legal concepts when advocating.    &amp;#x200b;  &gt;i don't even know how to properly contextualize this statement.  that part of my disabilities.  if you had replied to me last night i wouldn't have been able to respond at this level.  my symptoms get worse in the afternoon evenings.  i probably won't be able to respond to this level later today.  it's part of my dynamic disabilities.   &amp;#x200b;  &gt;again, i would more appropriately call that a ""medical issue,"" not a disability, but as you said, i am relying on the colloquial definition.  correct! what you call something has no legal bearing in this matter.  my medical issues are disabilities according to the ada, etc.    &amp;#x200b;  &gt;as an example, one of my dogs has epilepsy. she takes an opiate to manage it. i refer to that necessary as a medical condition, not a disability.  what you refer to your dog's conditions as have no bearing on my situation.  you can refer to it however you want.  that doesn't change the facts of my situation as they compare to laws.   &amp;#x200b;  &gt;sorry to hear that. but even here, you used the word ""condition"" and not ""disability,"" which i think means that, on some level, you understand the difference, whether you are willing to acknowledge it at all.  at this point, i just want to say ""fuck you"" and walk away.  my ""conditions"" are ""disabilities"" under the law.  arguing with you isn't going to help me resolve the discrimination i and others have faced.  i want to use what little energy i have to make a difference in this world not argue with someone who doesn't understand the definitions that apply to my situation.    most people's lay understandings have no bearing on this legal matter.  i think you know that and are just being a dick at this point despite saying you weren't being rude, etc.    the human rights commission and the hhs office of civil rights has amply evidence or can obtain it via their investigations.    my original post was to find others who have faced similar discrimination and/or willing to take action to address such discrimination.  you are clearly neither.  i really don't want to waste any more time or energy with you.",1,-2,2

906650,"its worth reading the actual report.  this is an update stated from jan 2017   the american college of pediatricians urges healthcare professionals, educators and legislators to reject all policies that condition children to accept as normal a life of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex. facts ‚Äì not ideology ‚Äì determine reality.  1. human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait: ‚Äúxy‚Äù and ‚Äúxx‚Äù are genetic markers of male and female, respectively ‚Äì not genetic markers of a disorder. the norm for human design is to be conceived either male or female. human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species. this principle is self-evident. the exceedingly rare disorders of sex development (dsds), including but not limited to testicular feminization and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm, and are rightly recognized as disorders of human design. individuals with dsds (also referred to as ‚Äúintersex‚Äù) do not constitute a third sex.1  2. no one is born with a gender. everyone is born with a biological sex. gender (an awareness and sense of oneself as male or female) is a sociological and psychological concept; not an objective biological one. no one is born with an awareness of themselves as male or female; this awareness develops over time and, like all developmental processes, may be derailed by a child‚Äôs subjective perceptions, relationships, and adverse experiences from infancy forward. people who identify as ‚Äúfeeling like the opposite sex‚Äù or ‚Äúsomewhere in between‚Äù do not comprise a third sex. they remain biological men or biological women.2,3,4  3. a person‚Äôs belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking. when an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such. these children suffer from gender dysphoria. gender dysphoria (gd), formerly listed as gender identity disorder (gid), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of the american psychiatric association (dsm-v).5 the psychodynamic and social learning theories of gd/gid have never been disproved.2,4,5  4. puberty is not a disease and puberty-blocking hormones can be dangerous. reversible or not, puberty- blocking hormones induce a state of disease ‚Äì the absence of puberty ‚Äì and inhibit growth and fertility in a previously biologically healthy child.6  5. according to the dsm-v, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty.5  6. pre-pubertal children who use puberty blockers to impersonate the opposite sex will require cross-sex hormones in late adolescence. this combination leads to permanent sterility. these children will never be able to conceive any genetically related children even via artificial reproductive technology. in addition, cross-sex hormones (testosterone and estrogen) are associated with dangerous health risks including but not limited to cardiac disease, high blood pressure, blood clots, stroke, diabetes, and cancer.7,8,9,10,11  7. rates of suicide are nearly twenty times greater among adults who use cross-sex hormones and undergo sex reassignment surgery, even in sweden which is among the most lgbtq ‚Äì affirming countries.12 what compassionate and reasonable person would condemn young children to this fate knowing that after puberty as many as 88% of girls and 98% of boys will eventually accept reality and achieve a state of mental and physical health?  8. conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse. endorsing gender discordance as normal via public education and legal policies will confuse children and parents, leading more children to present to ‚Äúgender clinics‚Äù where they will be given puberty-blocking drugs. this, in turn, virtually ensures they will ‚Äúchoose‚Äù a lifetime of carcinogenic and otherwise toxic cross-sex hormones, and likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults.  michelle a. cretella, m.d. president of the american college of pediatricians  quentin van meter, m.d. vice president of the american college of pediatricians pediatric endocrinologist  paul mchugh, m.d. university distinguished service professor of psychiatry at johns hopkins medical school and the former psychiatrist in chief at johns hopkins hospital  originally published march 2016 updated august 2016 updated january 2017  clarifications in response to faqs regarding points 3 &amp; 5:  regarding point 3: ‚Äúwhere does the apa or dsm-v indicate that gender dysphoria is a mental disorder?‚Äù  the apa (american psychiatric association) is the author of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 5th edition(dsm-v). the apa states that those distressed and impaired by their gd meet the definition of a disorder. the college is unaware of any medical literature that documents a gender dysphoric child seeking puberty blocking hormones who is not significantly distressed by the thought of passing through the normal and healthful process of puberty. from the dsm-v fact sheet:  ‚Äúthe critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.‚Äù ‚Äúthis condition causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.‚Äù  regarding point 5: ‚Äúwhere does the dsm-v list rates of resolution for gender dysphoria?‚Äù  on page 455 of the dsm-v under ‚Äúgender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development‚Äù it states: ‚Äúrates of persistence of gender dysphoria from childhood into adolescence or adulthood vary. in natal males, persistence has ranged from 2.2% to 30%. in natal females, persistence has ranged from 12% to 50%.‚Äù  simple math allows one to calculate that for natal boys: resolution occurs in as many as 100% ‚Äì 2.2% = 97.8% (approx. 98% of gender-confused boys)  similarly, for natal girls: resolution occurs in as many as 100% ‚Äì 12% = 88% gender-confused girls  the bottom line is this: our opponents advocate a new scientifically baseless standard of care for children with a psychological condition (gd) that would otherwise resolve after puberty for the vast majority of patients concerned.  specifically, they advise:  affirmation of children‚Äôs thoughts which are contrary to physical reality; the chemical castration of these children prior to puberty with gnrh agonists (puberty blockers which cause infertility, stunted growth, low bone density, and an unknown impact upon their brain development), and, finally, the permanent sterilization of these children prior to age 18 via cross-sex hormones. there is an obvious self-fulfilling nature to encouraging young gd children to impersonate the opposite sex and then institute pubertal suppression. if a boy who questions whether or not he is a boy (who is meant to grow into a man) is treated as a girl, then has his natural pubertal progression to manhood suppressed, have we not set in motion an inevitable outcome? all of his same sex peers develop into young men, his opposite sex friends develop into young women, but he remains a pre-pubertal boy. he will be left psychosocially isolated and alone. he will be left with the psychological impression that something is wrong. he will be less able to identify with his same sex peers and being male, and thus be more likely to self identify as ‚Äúnon-male‚Äù or female. moreover, neuroscience reveals that the pre-frontal cortex of the brain which is responsible for judgment and risk assessment is not mature until the mid-twenties. never has it been more scientifically clear that children and adolescents are incapable of making informed decisions regarding permanent, irreversible and life-altering medical interventions. for this reason, the college maintains it is abusive to promote this ideology, first and foremost for the well-being of the gender dysphoric children themselves, and secondly, for all of their non-gender-discordant peers, many of whom will subsequently question their own gender identity, and face violations of their right to bodily privacy and safety.  for more information, please visit this page on the college website concerning sexuality and gender issues.  a pdf version of this page can be downloaded here: gender ideology harms children",0,,
517137,"thanks for your reply. i'll sidestep all of your ad hominem attacks because i know this is a tense subject and emotions often flare unexpectedly.   &gt;okay first the fact that you followed ""source?"" with the use of the phrase ""vast majority"" with no source of your own is pretty galling.  it's a simple fact that circumcised people from cutting cultures tend to be glad they were cut. in countries such as egypt, saudi arabia and somalia where girls are circumcised, the circumcised *women* themselves are often the most ardent defenders of the practice, and they cite all the same myths, such as that ""it's cleaner"", ""it looks better"", ""it makes childbirth easier"", ""it's healthier"", ""no man will marry you if it's not done"", etc. the point i was trying to make is that cultural bias and lack of knowledge about the anatomical/sexual functions of their genitalia is the source of their defense of child genital cutting, because this is exactly the case in all cutting cultures, usa included, and your bullet points further reinforced this point!  &gt;1. people with no nervous sensation in their genitals (due to reasons other than fgm, like spinal cord injury) can experience good sex lives. clearly the ability to experience direct sexual pleasure, while certainly not something i would like to lose, is not a requirement for a self-identified good sex life  yes! exactly! sex still feels wonderful (although i'm not sure about your extreme example about spinal cord injury, where 100% erogenous sensation is removed. that is not the case in even the most extreme forms of fgm.)   &gt;if sexual sensation is disabled or blunted before sexual maturity then its absence may never be noted  yes! exactly my point! bravo. people who were born blind say they do not miss the ability to see. similarly, people who lose their foreskins at birth say they do not miss fully functional genitalia, even as they buy artificial lubrication in heaps and gobs.  &gt;the most common cultural basis for fgm is the idea that it is immoral for women to experience pleasure from sex; if you are a woman raised in such a culture, your definition of ""a good sex life"" might be one that involves being a passive recipient without pleasure  well, i see your point about the true intent of it being to blunt sexual pleasure. but in the case of fgm it's just more explicit, whereas the sex-negative origins of foreskin amputation are just less known and under appreciated. it originated in the usa as a cure for masturbation, the great jewish philosopher/physican mamoinades wrote thousands of years ago that the intent is to reduce sexual pleasure and sensation, etc.  ok bro. i digressed and spent more time than i wanted to on mgm/fgm comparison. but i wanted to emphasize that i in *no way* meant to minimize or defend the disgusting practice of female genital cutting, only to point out the western bias in believing that the majority of fgm are the worst type, committed under the most unsanitary conditions, when in actuality, most moms are taking their daughters to have it done by the doctor. http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-2203-6  but let's move past this whole comparison between female genital cutting and male genital cutting, because i think the *real* reason it's difficult for you to see any parallels is because you believe in some faulty premises:  &gt;there is no significant reduction in capacity for pleasure associated with circumcision  says who? the surveys of men circumcised at birth who were asked to rate their sex lives on a scale of 1 to 10? based on your own point #2 regarding genital mutilation, people who lose a portion of their sensations before sexual maturity are not really capable of measuring or rating what they have lost.  if you do a google search, you will find out that the foreskin is the most sensitive part of the human penis, and the frenulum (usually removed as well, mine was) is the second most sensitive part:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17378847  you just can't really get around this simple anatomical fact that the foreskin is densely innervated with ""fine-touch"" receptors. i was once like most people, and assumed the foreskin was like the skin of the elbow, not even part of the penis, but actually *covering up* the penis like a nuisance or something extraneous. now i've learned that it's an *integral* part of the penis, it's the surface of the penis, the true tip of the penis (when flaccid), and has evolved to be exquisitely sensitive.   &gt;the only thing that foreskin restoration is supposed to - and indeed can - accomplish is to make your dick look uncircumcised again  not quite. although one clear goal is to reclaim a natural appearance, there are other things that can be ""restored"" as well:  * restores the gliding mechanism, aka ""rolling bearing"" or frictionless stimulation. this is huge, like having a built-in jerk-off sleeve * covering the glans so that it de-keratinizes and halts the progression of dulling due to chronic exposure * restore some degree of moisture/lubrication so that the glans becomes moist and supple again  &gt;also, as someone who is a fan of uncut dicks: your natural foreskin is also a ""grotesque skin tube"".  ok, here's what i meant by that. your actual foreskin contains all the related structures such as the dartos muscle that draws it close at the tip like a purse string, all of the sebaceous glands, stretch receptors, meissner's corpuscles. but visually, the foreskin is quite sleek and slender, whereas ""restored"" ""foreskins"" are significantly thicker, and frankly, are not your foreskin. it's just not. i so wish it was, but it isn't. if i had an identical twin brother, his would not look like mine, because mine would not be my foreskin but an artificial one, albeit made out of my own foreskin remnant. i hope you can see the difference, and why it was not to be hyperbolic in the least that i referred to it as ""grotesque"". if my ear lobe were cut off, and then i tugged on my ear stump until i grew a new ""ear lobe"" you might call that grotesque, too.  &gt;i think you are overselling the hardship here. you wear a tugger that stresses the remaining foreskin tissue in such a way that the tissue slowly grows in surface area. it's like a retainer for your cock, basically.   i'm not exaggerating my hardship. again, just a few points from someone who has actually been restoring now for 3+ years:  * there are devices that can be worn. i own some of them and use them daily. they have to be cleaned every day, sometimes multiple times of day, to get them to grip the skin. * there are multiple ways you have to wear the device, to target different types of remnant. the skin above the scar line that attaches to the glans is the inner mucosa remnant (the inner lining of the foreskin) while the skin below the scar line that attaches to the belly is the outer foreskin remant. each type of tissue has to be tensioned differently, and it requires much more strategy and foreplanning than you might realize in order to succeed in tensioning these properly. a great deal of education goes into it, you will learn more about the anatomy of the penis than you ever thought possible. * as you succeed in expanding the remnant, your methods also have to change. you have to constantly be reevaluating your regimen * last but not least, for many restorers, it's an emotionally harrowing process. as you become intimately aware of the parts of your penis that were cut off, it can be quite challenging to have it in your face every single day that they are gone forever. moreover, as skin is expanded and more natural sensations are achieved, especially for me while jerking off, it really hits you in the gut just how natural and normal and wonderful it is to have these mechanical sensations, such as the skin gliding over the glans. i have personally talked to and read the accounts of several other restorers who struggled with this psychological aspect of restoring. on the one hand you are sublimating your grief into something constructive and positive, but on the other hand, you are faced with a poignant reminder on a day to day basis, when it's frankly easier a lot of the time to simply ignore it and not think about it.  &gt;. i sincerely doubt that spending the rest of your life dying on this rhetorical hill is going to make you feel any better  i can't grow my foreskin back. all i can do is try to raise awareness on this cruel and wasteful practice. yes, i am pretty passionate in my intactivism, but i hope you are able to at least examine the facts i've presented rather than merely trying to discredit the source. i am amenable to having my view changed, but you would have to actually present facts, rather than just look at my post history and write me off as a lunatic.  thank you for listening. i look forward to hearing your reply.",0,,
430224,"&gt;women try to kill themselves three times more often than men.  is it a competition? if so, let's see who might have ""more"" reasons to be unhappy. let's see who has it worse, from birth.  since women have two x chromosomes, they are more resistant to genetic-linked disorders. also, during pregnancy some cells traffic between the fetus and mother, and male fetal cells in the maternal circulation are known to trigger a maternal rejection response. so most stillbirths are male, and most genetic and developmental disorders affect males in much greater numbers than females. this also causes the male immune system to be weakened, or underdeveloped, as boys are more than 20% more likely than girls to die in their first years of life, and a gender disparity in mortality related to natural causes persists throughout life.  when reading the following, remember that suicide is more likely among disabled people:  * for every 100 girls diagnosed with a special education disability **217** boys are diagnosed with a special education disability.  * for every 100 girls diagnosed with a learning disability **276** boys are diagnosed with a learning disability.  * for every 100 girls diagnosed with emotional disturbance **324** boys are diagnosed with emotional disturbance  * for every 100 girls diagnosed with a speech impairment **147** boys are similarly diagnosed.  * for every 100 girls diagnosed with mental retardation **138** boys are diagnosed as mentally retarded.  * for every 100 girls diagnosed with visual impairment **125** boys are visually impaired.  * for every 100 girls diagnosed with hearing impairment **108** boys are diagnosed as hearing impaired.  * for every 100 girls diagnosed with deafness **120** boys have deafness.  * for every 100 girls with orthopedic impairment **118** boys have orthopedic impairment.  * for every 100 girls with other health impairment **127** boys have other health impairment.  * for every 100 girls with multiple disabilities **189** boys have multiple disabilities.  ([source](http://www.iteachilearn.com/uh/meisgeier/statsgov20gender.htm))  not to mention the many genetic/biological handicaps which appear later in life, with which men are also generally burdened in greater numbers. all of this contributing with lower quality of life and general reasons to be unhappy.  i am a stutterer. i am not suicidal, but at times my stuttering has made me consider it. the powerlessness, the hopelessness, the pain of embarrassment ‚Äì just end it all. i can say there's plenty of reason to be unhappy.   well, stuttering (which has an important genetic component, contrary to popular belief) afflicts only 1 woman for every 4 men who stutter, and who also tend to stutter worse. look up the mtv real life episode on stuttering. check out how much harder than the girls the dude stutters. see the toll it's taken on his life, while the girls are able to pretty much go on with theirs. not just by their own merit, but thanks to society's acceptance as well.  my mom has 4 siblings, 2 male and 2 female. she has sickle cell disease, as do her 2 brothers. her sisters never manifested the disease. my mother did, and it's bad, but she never needed to stay at a hospital for that. my uncles do, almost on a yearly basis now. the average life expectancy is 48 years old for women, 42 for men. their quality of life has also always been significantly lower.  back on depression, the majority of mental care professionals now agree that male depression is dramatically under-reported, and that it's probably due to diagnostic bias: since we studied depression mostly through depressed *women* during the past century, we thought the symptoms exhibited by women were what all depression looked like. we now know that's not the case.  men are far more likely to develop compulsive and obsessive; often self-destructive; habits, such as substance abuse, pervasive hobbies and interests, being workaholics, prone to anger and violence, etc. research shows all of these traits are intimately connected to the now called ""typical"" male depression. except people rarely identify it as such. they think it's normal male behavior. when men start to exhibit symptoms of the ""traditional"" depression; if ever; it's often already too late. indeed, men often commit suicide ""out of the blue"", similar to what happens with those shooters. people don't see it coming because they don't see in them what they expect to, when they think of depression or suicide. also, unlike women, men don't feel it's ok for them to seek help ‚Äì most of the time they're not even aware that they need any. they were never educated to recognize their symptoms. and for men it is a greater stigma to be thought of as ""weak"", which is an almost immediate correlate to depression. so they often fake it until they absolutely cannot, anymore.  * for every 100 females ages 15 to 19 that commit suicide **549** males in the same range kill themselves.  * for every 100 females ages 20 to 24 that commit suicide **624** males of the same age kill themselves.  ([source](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/lcwk1_2002.pdf))  going back to [that first source](http://www.iteachilearn.com/uh/meisgeier/statsgov20gender.htm), we learn that, from kids diagnosed with some kind of ""emotional disturbance"", 79.4 of those are boys. in fact, [boys commit 86 percent of all adolescent suicides](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/01/26/baghrgt0dv1.dtl).  &gt; it occurred to me that if 86 percent of adolescent suicides were girls, there would be a national commission to find out why. there'd be front-page stories and oprah shows and nonprofit foundations throwing money at sociologists and psychologists to study female self-destruction. my feminist sisters and i would be asking, rightly, **""what's wrong with a culture that drives girls, much more than boys, to take their own lives?""** &gt; &gt; ‚Ä¶    &gt;  &gt; so why aren't we asking what's wrong with a culture that drives boys, much more than girls, to take their own lives? &gt; &gt; ‚Ä¶    &gt;  &gt; ""as much as i would love to lead the charge (in finding out why boys kill themselves), try to go out and get funding for it,"" said lanny berman, the executive director of the [american association of suicidology]. *he is frustrated that funders aren't interested in studying boys and men.* &gt; &gt; ‚Ä¶    &gt;  &gt; **so the association has an expert on female suicide but none on male suicide, even though suicide is an overwhelmingly male issue well beyond adolescence.**  the most consistent factor for suicide in adults is divorce. there's a *dramatic rise* in suicide following a divorce ‚Äì for men, not that much for women. (on a related note, most divorces are initiated by the woman. take from that what you will.)  unemployment is also a huge factor in suicides. both men and women become unemployed, sure, but men are mostly bred to have their sense of worth almost entirely based on financial and professional success. for a woman to be successful, she can be a successful professional, a stay-at-home mother and wife, or some combination of both. men's path for success overwhelmingly consists of only the first route. when they are hit there, they have every right to feel it harder. they have nothing left.  given all that is actually known about depression and suicide, some of which was mentioned above, excuse me if i have a hard time believing the reason women don't actually get themselves killed is that ""they just don't like guns"".",1,,-2

515311,"respectfully, not being able to see and not being able to read are not the same thing, you can still read with braille or some word to speech technology.  to the contrary of what you claim, blind people have lives that are just as fulfilling as those that can see, they‚Äôre just fulfilling it in a different matter that sighted people can‚Äôt ever experience.  most blind people can certainly be happy having just four senses left. when vision is removed, the vision-impaired tend to focus more on their other senses and find happiness there.  on the other hand, there are many non-blind people who can never be happy. attitude is everything. if you‚Äôre dissatisfied with life and you view life as a vale of tears, it doesn‚Äôt really matter if your vision is intact or impaired.  personally i feel you‚Äôll really like the medical model, also known as the ""tragedy model,"" looks at disability as tragic, an aversion from the ""norm,"" and something that must be fixed. this view casts people who have disabilities aside, marginalizing them and labeling them as a class beneath those with fully functioning limbs, senses, or other ""less-than-desirable"" traits.  the framing of need is key in the medical model because the aim is to make the disabled person normal, and the reason that they aren‚Äôt normal is that there is something wrong with their body. the individual therefore needs society to help them be normal.  the construct of need in the medical model, coupled with the designation of professionals as specialists on disabilities means that many services designed for disabled people are separate from non-disabled services in healthcare, social care, education and most other arenas.  this requires disabled people to be separated from non-disabled peers and services in order to access standard and support services.  under the medical model, people are often perceived not as whole people, but as their impairments or medical conditions first‚Ä¶ and all else second.  the perceived need associated with whatever impairment they have is seen as the fundamental aspect of their being that should be engaged with in health services, education services, welfare services, legal services, and often socially too.  the medical model is used widely in the modern world. it underpins most medical and healthcare services globally. it also shapes public policy. even work capability assessments (the assessment for disability and sickness benefits in the uk) is tested by an assessment of the things your body can and cannot do.  interestingly, there‚Äôs growing evidence that these assessments bias against particular subsections of disabled people: poor people, women and people with mental health conditions ‚Äî suggesting that eugenics-model thinking is still at play in medical model practice.  the medical model also exists in the education system, most visibly in the practice of special needs, special educational needs (sen) and special educational needs and disabilities (sen/d).  the construct of special needs fits the medical model in two ways; it suggests that disabled people need help and that said help necessitates specialist support. additionally, the inclusion of disability in the sen/d acronym implies that all disabled people need special educational support, even though many disabled people learn in the same way as their non-disabled peers.  the delivery of sen/ sen/d support in schools is also often separated from mainstream education. while it might be true that a range of students ‚Äî including disabled students ‚Äî might need specific support in education, the construct of special needs is derived from medical-model thinking.  it is based on a philosophy of a normative form of education (usually called mainstream) and specialist support for people who need to learn in different ways. it seems to be failing many of the students it classifies as sen/d who are more likely to be excluded, to be unemployed, to end up in prison, or to live in poverty.  in fact, we see similar patterns of eugenicist thinking in education as in social care.  in 2009/10, 84.2% of pupils who were permanently excluded had either special educational needs, were eligible for free school meals or were black caribbean (or a combination therein) in the uk.  this leads us onto the ways that the medical model exists in attitudes as well as practice.  societies and individuals recreate the construct of non-disabled as normal in latent and blatant ways regularly.  language is one way that cultural ideas are practiced in unintentional ways.  a key word from the medical model lexicon was ‚Äúhandicapped‚Äù. there are various accounts of the etymology of the phrase, but simply it means that someone has a physical limitation.  other medical model language includes phrases like ‚Äúthe handicapped‚Äù or ‚Äúthe blind‚Äù to refer to disabled or blind people as whole subsections of society, homogenous and other.  in response to this, many disabled people started to advocate for people first language where they would be seen as a person, where before they were seen as their impairment.  in that way they might be a person with a disability or a person with a visual impairment.  the phrase ‚Äúable-bodied‚Äù is, although commonly used today, also derived from the medical model. in identifying people who aren‚Äôt disabled as able-bodied, we understand the opposite of disabled to be abled.  this both infers that disabled people aren‚Äôt able and also that disability is located in a person‚Äôs body, that disability is physical and that disability is visible.  this thinking is so commonplace that we often assume all disabled people are in wheelchairs or use mobility aids, and that disabled people are most often born disabled. in fact, only 8% of disabled people use a wheelchair and only 17% are born disabled.  there are a number of models which branch off from the medical model, notable offshoots worth looking at are the tragedy or charity models.  these models view disability as tragic and something to be pitied. the charity model encourages non-disabled people to work to support and save disabled people from their personal tragedy of disability.  often disability charities generate funds from supporters by using advertising that represents disabled people as worthy of pity and help in order to find cures or meet the needs of their disability.  however, in the 1970s and 80s, disabled people started responding to what they perceived was disempowering and infantilising attitudes towards them born of the medical model, and they started to develop and advocate for a new way of thinking: the social model.  this shifted the way we conceptualise disability from in the body to thinking of it as constructed by society.",1,,2

broken on my radeon 9250, enabling agp x4 causes freezes, and an optimization needs to be disabled in xorg.conf to avoid text corruption.  has xvideo support.  r3xx, r4xx: have open-source driver originating at [r300.sf.net](http://r300.sourceforge.net/), which is flakier and lacks more 3d features than the r200.  r500+: i don't believe [that 3d support is in yet](http://www.phoronix.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-4115.html).  given that this should be an xorg issue, and not simply a kernel issue, i'd imagine that it would affect the bsds as well.  &gt;sorry to hear it. some wireless network adapters are not well supported with linux (or freebsd), i hear. i've avoided the problem since 2003, apparently.  this isn't all, mind you, but it requires careful shopping to avoid issues.  i've a centrino-using laptop that works well, but a friend who didn't pay attention to his wireless chipset when purchasing a laptop finally gave up after multiple attempts to use ndiswrapper.  &gt;i'm not familiar with the problem.  just a piece of hardware that i happen to have.  it stopped compiling somewhere in the 2.6 series, and i stopped trying it.  ended up swapping my usb-based x10 interface for a serial interface device.  &gt;my wireless five-button mouse with scroll wheel ""just works"" (except that it's physically wearing out) with freebsd. i didn't have this thing when last i ran a linux-based os on a desktop or laptop, however, so maybe there's some difference there.  could be.  the driver is certainly capable of handling it; it's just not configured.  oh, and the tilt wheel in my mouse didn't function out-of-box either with the fedora 8 automatic configuration stuff, though i did get that going.  &gt;overall, hardware support is no worse with free unix-like systems these days than with ms windows.  i disagree that it's no worse, at least from the standpoint of a typical end user.  there are several issues here:  configuration must be automatic.  i have no problem running lsusb/lspci, grabbing the vendor and product ids, and poking around online to figure out how to rig up a device or what driver runs it.  that won't fly with a typical user, and it was necessary for at least four devices that i own.  even if the driver supports it, it has to be set up and working for the user.  i've used the following pointing devices:  * a four-button logitech mouse  * a trackball (which i wanted to slow down without slowing down the regular mouse -- not sure if windows can do this, to be fair)  * a mouse with two scroll wheels  * a five-button logitech mouse with tilt wheels.  every one of these required manually mucking around in the xfree/xorg config file to get the features working.  granted, this goes back to an older linux than is around today, but my point is that this is not a one-off issue.  i never did get that second scroll wheel working, and that's despite dumping out all messages coming in from the device at an event level.  i've a sound blaster live! value (well, one of the many pieces of hardware with that moniker).  it has wavetable synth; using this requires modifying modprobe.conf to trigger sfxload, a binary that uploads a soundfont to the card when the driver loads (or the notes play, but with no wavetables loaded).  it's possible to write programs for the programmable dsp onboard and there's an upload program, but unlike windows, there's no ""reverb"" slider.  when doing capture, one is presented with alsamixer's largely opaque interface.  it has *fifty-four* sliders/buttons.  i'm not saying that the functionality isn't exposed, but i can't imagine my mother being terribly enlightened by controls reading, ""sigmatel surround phase inversion playback [off]"", ""iec958 ttl capture"", ""ac97 capture"", ""line2 livedrive 1"", ""wave lfe"", or ""synth"" (the last is for the wavetable synthesizer, as i discovered with experimentation).  these, iirc, were all muted initially, and some override or affect each other, so to get basic capture or playthrough working, one has to figure out what all these controls do.  i've played around with /etc/printcap quite a bit.  i used to have rigged up a custom print filter that did all the postscript rendering on my host side and then uploaded a compressed bitmap to my low-memory printer.  while that flexibility was cool, not requiring the manual editing of config files to add a printer was necessary.  cups has a web-based ui that still isn't as convenient as the ""stick a cd in the drive, click ok a bunch of times"" approach that happens on windows, and i don't have an ink reservoir status display any more, but printing is probably one of the better highlights.  i haven't had to install fedora from scratch recently, so i can't tell you what monitor installation is like.  last time i dealt with this, i was manually plugging in monitor sizes and didling modelines.  things might have gotten better, but the ubuntu laptop i picked up recently had a bug in its print driver that was causing the hardware scaler to kick in (as shipped by dell), making everything blurry.  turned out to be an off-by-one error in the driver -- found a patch on a forum, pulled down the dpkg, decompressed it, applied the patch, rebuilt the dpkg, installed it, and pinned the package to keep the repository from replacing it, but i doubt that my mother would be thrilled to deal with this.  i'm not grousing.  this is not stuff that i can't do (well, some of it i'd like to avoid, but it's not a huge problem).  i really do like the ability to directly view hardware data and configure things via a (reasonably editable, not some xml awfulness) config file.  however, plug-it-in-and-use-all-features-of-any-hardware it's not.  these issues aren't really caused by fundamental problems.  some of it is a lack of vendor support resources for a smaller market (ati has traditionally fallen into this camp).  windows has more users, so windows gets more driver dev hours from the vendor.  some are from higher demands from linux users -- i don't want to use closed-source drivers, so i won't use the vendor-provided closed drivers from ati/nvidia.  a lot of it comes down to a need for better automated detection, and udev has improved things in the past few years.  some of it is the fact that microsoft has placed binary driver compatibility as a goal...one that hasn't really been the case in the linux world, which makes life a real headache for vendors that want to ship closed drivers.  some of it is the result of fragmentation -- if a vendor wants to provide screenshots and install directions, do they do so for the console, gnome, kde, and for which distribution?  that doesn't mean that i think that there's anything wrong with linux.  i use only linux boxes.  but i'm not going to claim that the hardware situation, for a typical user, is the same as that under windows -- it really isn't.  we're mostly past the hard hurdle of having a driver there at all -- you can generally download something that will get most pieces of hardware doing something, albeit perhaps without all the features available.  maybe your graphics card only has 2d support, or maybe you don't have tv out or dual-head monitor support, or maybe your sound card doesn't have reverb or you can't see how much ink is in your printer, but the primary functionality is working.  the problem is one of making everything packaged *with* a distribution and automatically detected and configured and made available to an end user in a reasonable fashion, if one wants to appeal to the same market that windows targets.  that means no typing device names (what's a ""/dev/video""?)  that means no looking at hardware identifiers in /proc.  fedora 8 added a sound server called pulseaudio in an attempt to make software mixing transparent (up until now, normally a user explicitly chose to use software mixing via the driver -- dmix in alsa -- or sound server -- artsd, esound, etc).  that tended to yield poor mixing quality, worse sound latency, etc, so there's been work underway to make things more transparent.  when i upgraded to fedora 8, sound simply stopped working.  it was a mix of problems related to pulseaudio and was ultimately fixed at this end by rigging udev to add an acl entry to the /dev/dsp* and /dev/snd/* devices and to yank the alsa pulseaudio backend, but ""i upgraded and now sound doesn't work"" would be considered a pretty big showstopper in the windows world, i suspect, when it comes to hardware configuration.  &gt;the problems are, if even equal to those of ms windows (rather than less problematic), just different.  the problems under windows are more of an ""old hardware just doesn't work"" or ""i can't see what the hardware is really doing"" nature, which isn't a huge deal for most users.  the problems under linux tend to be more of a ""you need to build a driver/look at usb/pci device information/modify config files/etc"" nature.  these aren't huge barriers to a sysadmin or programmer, but are pretty much blockers for a typical end user.",0,,

 first of, that's not a cited source.  secondly, that's irrelevant as that would include going to work, or getting groceries. things which likely could be taken by public transportation, but isn't because people find driving far easier and faster, than dealing with a bus system.  &gt;the reason someone from outside ottawa is able to drive around ottawa is because most of the residents are on transit - if they weren't, the whole place would be gridlocked. so, i guess... you're welcome?  under 20% of ottawa residents use public transportation. only around 30% use public/walk/bike.  https://www.ottawainsights.ca/themes/environment-and-sustainability/transportation/  70% of ottawa residents don't use public transportation.  so you're litterally just wrong?  &gt;i didn't propose high speed inter-city rail from coast-to-coast.   cool. then people will still need cars to visit family. so the citizens will need housing that can accommodate their cars. so they'll just end up using them anyhow in the city.  so there's likely no point in this conversation as private car useage isn't going to decline.  which is a point you can't seem to grasp.  &gt;who do you think? there are roads and daily flights between those locations.  ah yes roads. that means we need to have high speed rail.  from what i can tell here,  https://www.flights.com/flights/detroit-dtw-to-toronto-yyz/  there's 3 flights per day between toronto and detroit. going through the ticket information, i find, at least one plane, is aa4477  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/aal4477  which is an embraer 170/175 (twin-jet) plane, which has a seating capacity of 70.  so that's 210 people a day.  looking here;  http://ushsr.org/benefits/capacity.html  high speed rail transports 20000 people per hour, and a single train having 1100 people. while this one could be shorter, it's still vastly overkill.  we can now look here;  https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/high-speed-rail-train-toronto-windsor-kitchener-london-1.4121663  and see a high-speed rail is $55 million per km. just to build.  with 370km roughly from detroit to toronto, that's 22.3 billion. for 210 people. or just over 96 million per person. at $1000 for a flight ticket, that's 96904 tickets. per person. or one ticket every day for 265 days, for 210 people.  basically what i'm saying here is it's a giant waste of money that wouldn't do any good unless we expected the traffic to go up by a few orders of magnitude.  like, 3. 1000 times more traffic.  &gt;significantly less chance of dying, easier, more comfortable.  lol, you're kidding right?  easier? you have to now deal with schedules, other people being late, transportation to and from the train station on both sides, transportation to do whatever you're planning on doing when you get there.  vs just put it in google and drive.  and comfortable? you can't even control the temperature. you can't control the noise of other passengers, the smells of other passengers, etc.  being alone in a car is far superior.  &gt;but more importantly i can read a book or chill out, and i'm happy and rested when i get there instead of tired from concentrating on the road  lol if you get stressed by driving a car, you're a pussy plain and simple. try driving a semi downtown into and out of back alleys mate.  furthermore, audiobooks exist. you can chill out while driving, while being in charge for your own actions.  &gt;most buses have disabled seats right behind the driver  wheelchair seats. because the front door doubles as a ramp, and the seat folds up to allow the chair to fit.  the blind don't need to sit right there. and would need to give up their seat if a wheelchair bound person needed on.  &gt;there are classes of blindness which disqualify you from driving but don't leave you totally blind  in canada legal blindness starts at 20/200 *after* corrective lenses. if you consider yourself having normal vision, look at a billboard from 200 feet away.  that not-yet legally blind person would have to be 20 feet away from the billboard to see it at the quality you do. with glasses on. and they'd get a license.  the amount of people that fit in this category is astronomically low.   &gt;2% of canadians have sight loss which affects their daily lives.  define ""affects"".  83% of people with impaired vision can have it fixed with lenses/contacts.  https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/study-finds-most-americans-have-good-vision-14-million-are-visually-impaired  so that number is likely only 14% of that 2%... but we'll never know because you seem unable to provide sources.  &gt;because there's a load of boomers out there who are deliberately evading their retests and driving dangerously.  and? those younger than boomer's are using cell phones and driving. 1.6 million crashes a year as a result.  https://www.caa.ca/driving-safely/distracted-driving/statistics/#:~:text=mobile%20phone%20use%20while%20driving%20leads%20to%201.6%20million%20crashes%20annually.  and you point to... ""several cases"".  sounds to me like they were driving fine for years and finally had an accident.  &gt;lots of developed countries are going to need to get much stricter about pulling pensioner's licences  [citation needed]  fuck over regulation.   &gt;meanwhile, enjoy driving in the knowledge that the driver coming the other way might have cataracts in both eyes (and the odds of it are going up every year!).  cool.  i'd rather be in a car in such a scenario than walking or on a bike. like one would use to transfer buses, or go from train to bus.  &gt;and just like that, you lost your court case for discrimination. nice.  lol, you do understand i'm saying blind people can't draw blueprints right? you don't see how that's, oh i don't know, a fucking fact?  &gt;seriously, move to a us red state - you'll like it more (aside from the healthcare).  i actually plan to. also i hate the canadian healthcare system. it took 7 months to get in for a 45 minute surgery that was preventing me from legally working. 9 months, counting the recovery, without an income.  it would have been financially better to get a line of credit, and pay for the surgery out of pocket. but i couldn't imagine that it would take so long. but hey look at that, that's what happens when a doctor can make 3 times more by just moving south.  &gt;because i am concerning myself solely with urban and suburban transit  cool. and by doing so, you cement the fact those people will always have a need for, and thus use, a private car.  &gt;pretty sure i never said anything about sandwiches in my previous post... nope.  yeah, i said it. your story fell apart as a result of fucking sandwiches.  read kid.  &gt;just checking, yup. i said exactly the opposite. not financially wealthy. that's what i said - you even quoted it for truth. nothing like alternative facts eh.   you live in a city. you likely think anything less than 120k/ year is poor as you live in a 2000/month one bedroom apartment.  also fucking hilarious you blocked me. what a fucking loser, can't even have a conversation.",1,,-1

because we know they're not racist. their niggers! context. context. we don't mind their context because we know they're black. hey, i know i'm whitey, the blue-eyed devil, paddy-o, fay gray boy, honkey, mother-fucker myself. don't bother my ass. their only words. you can't be afraid of words that speak the truth, even if it's an unpleasant truth, like the fact that there's a bigot and a racist in every living room on every street corner in this country.  &amp;#x200b;  i don't like words that hide the truth. i don't words that conceal reality. i don't like euphemisms, or euphemistic language. and american english is loaded with euphemisms. cause americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality. americans have trouble facing the truth, so they invent the kind of a soft language to protest themselves from it, and it gets worse with every generation. for some reason, it just keeps getting worse. i'll give you an example of that. there's a condition in combat. most people know about it. it's when a fighting person's nervous system has been stressed to it's absolute peak and maximum. can't take anymore input. the nervous system has either (click) snapped or is about to snap. in the first world war, that condition was called *shell shock*. simple, honest, direct language. two syllables, *shell shock*. almost sounds like the guns themselves. that was seventy years ago. then a whole generation went by and the second world war came along and very same combat condition was called *battle fatigue*. four syllables now. takes a little longer to say. doesn't seem to hurt as much. fatigue is a nicer word than shock. shell shock! battle fatigue. then we had the war in korea, 1950. madison avenue was riding high by that time, and the very same combat condition was called operational exhaustion. hey, were up to eight syllables now! and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase. it's totally sterile now. operational exhaustion. sounds like something that might happen to your car. then of course, came the war in viet nam, which has only been over for about sixteen or seventeen years, and thanks to the lies and deceits surrounding that war, i guess it's no surprise that the very same condition was called post-traumatic stress disorder. still eight syllables, but we've added a hyphen! and the pain is completely buried under jargon. post-traumatic stress disorder. i'll bet you if we'd of still been calling it shell shock, some of those viet nam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time. i'll betcha. i'll betcha.  but. but, it didn't happen, and one of the reasons. one of the reasons is because we were using that *soft* language. that language that takes the life out of life. and it is a function of time. it does keep getting worse. i'll give you another example. sometime during my life. sometime during my life, toilet paper became bathroom tissue. i wasn't notified of this. no one asked me if i agreed with it. it just happened. toilet paper became bathroom tissue. sneakers became running shoes. false teeth became dental appliances. medicine became medication. information became directory assistance. the dump became the landfill. car crashes became automobile accidents. partly cloudy bacame partly sunny. motels became motor lodges. house trailers became mobile homes. used cars became previously owned transportation. room service became guest-room dining. and constipation became occasional irregularity. when i was a little kid, if i got sick they wanted me to go to the hospital and see a doctor. now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization...or a wellness center to consult a healthcare delivery professional. poor people used to live in slums. now the economically disadvantaged occupy substandard housing in the inner cities. and they're broke! they're broke! they don't have a negative cash-flow position. they're fucking broke! cause a lot of them were fired. you know, fired. management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area, so many people are no longer viable members of the workforce.  smug, greedy, well-fed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins. it's as simple as that. the cia doesn't kill anybody anymore, they neutralize people...or they depopulate the area. the government doesn't lie, it engages in disinformation. the pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation in something they call sunshine units. israeli murderers are called commandos. arab commandos are called terrorists. contra killers are called freedom fighters. well, if crime fighters fight crime and fire fighters fight fire, what do freedom fighters fight? they never mention that part of it to us, do they? never mention that part of it.  and...and some of this stuff is just silly, we all know that, like on the airlines, they say want to pre- board. well, what the hell is pre-board, what does that mean? to get on before you get on? they say they're going to pre-board those passengers in need of special assistance. cripples! simple honest direct language. there is no shame attached to the word cripple that i can find in any dictionary. no shame attached to it, in fact it's a word used in bible translations. jesus healed the cripples. doesn't take seven words to describe that condition. but we don't have any cripples in this country anymore. we have *the physically challenged*. is that a grotesque enough evasion for you? how about *differently abled*. i've heard them called that. differently abled! you can't even call these people handicapped anymore. they'll say, ""were not handicapped. were handicapable!"" these poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition, somehow you'll change the condition. well, hey cousin, ppsssspptttttt. doesn't happen. doesn't happen.  we have no more deaf people in this country, hearing impaired. no ones blind anymore, partially sighted or visually impaired. we have no more stupid people. everyone has a learning disorder...or he's minimally exceptional. how would you like to be told that about your child? ""he's minimally exceptional."" ""oohh, thank god for that."" psychologists actually have started calling ugly people, those with severe appearance deficits. it's getting so bad, that any day now i expect to hear a rape victim referred to as an unwilling sperm recipient.  and we have no more old people in this country. no more old people. we shipped them all away, and we brought in these *senior citizens*. isn't that a typically american twentieth century phrase? bloodless, lifeless, no pulse in one of them. a *senior citizen*. but i've accepted that one, i've come to terms with it. i know it's to stay. we'll never get rid of it. that's what they're going to be called, so i'll relax on that, but the one i do resist. the one i keep resisting is when they look at an old guy and they'll say, ""look at him dan! he's ninety years young."" imagine the fear of aging that reveals. to not even be able to use the word ""old"" to describe somebody. to have to use an antonym. and fear of aging is natural. it's universal. isn't it? we all have that. no one wants to get old. no one wants to die, but we do! so we bullshit ourselves. i started bullshitting myself when i got to my forties. as soon as i got into my forties i'd look in the mirror and i'd say, ""well, i...i guess i'm getting...older."" older sounds a little better than old doesn't it? sounds like it might even last a little longer. bullshit, i'm getting old! and it's okay, because thanks to our fear of death in this country, i won't have to die...i'll pass away. or i'll expire like a magazine subscription. if it happens in the hospital, they'll call it a terminal episode. the insurance company will refer to it as negative patient-care outcome. and if it's the result of malpractice, they'll say it was a  ^((trimmed due to comment size limit)^)",1,,-2

287686,"frontline/world goes inside china‚Äôs ‚Äúunderground‚Äù christian church -- plus more stories from a small planet  tuesday, june 24, 2008, at 9:00 p.m. on pbs  www.pbs.org/frontlineworld   ""jesus in china""  a massive wave of christianity has been sweeping across china in recent years, and the chinese ruling party, officially atheist, is now struggling to figure out how to control it. in ‚Äújesus in china,‚Äù a joint project of frontline/world and the chicago tribune, airing tuesday, june 24, 2008, at 9:00 p.m. et on pbs (check local listings), reporter evan osnos investigates one of the fastest growing christian populations in the world, and how it could potentially transform china at this explosive moment in the country‚Äôs development.  osnos travels first to henan province, a place known as the ‚Äúbethlehem of china,‚Äù home to china‚Äôs largest population of christians. here, members of an ‚Äúunderground‚Äù christian church tell osnos that, until recently, they worshipped in caves high above some farmers‚Äô fields in henan to avoid detection by the government. walking through the weeds and woods where they used to pray, church members publicly describe for the first time the extremes to which they went to conceal their services: ‚Äúthe cave on the left was our bible classroom. the one on the right was the prayer cave for 5:00 in the morning. the children came here, too.‚Äù  ‚Äúthis is what it‚Äôs like when a church is underground,‚Äù says zhang yinan, a historian of chinese christianity. zhang and others say they are coming forward because the government is now signaling a new openness to their faith. but the dangers remain: in an underground ‚Äúhouse church,‚Äù osnos meets the wife of a well-known chinese christian whose husband has been jailed at least five times in recent years. ‚Äúhe was sentenced to seven years in prison the first time,‚Äù she says of her husband, zhang rongliang. ‚Äúthe second time, 11 months. the third time, three years in a labor camp....‚Äù  in the last few years, the chinese government has arrested hundreds of house church leaders and, in some cases, destroyed the house churches themselves. still, the chinese government recognizes that its homegrown christian movement can no longer simply be branded an instrument of foreign influence and suppressed. last year in beijing, the government raised the profile of its ‚Äúofficial,‚Äù state-controlled christian church, opening a multimillion-dollar ‚Äúmegachurch,‚Äù complete with coffee bar. a senior member of china‚Äôs state administration of religious affairs, ma yuhong, tells osnos that the party is embracing the religion that it once rejected. ‚Äúin the old days, there used to be this saying, ‚Äòone more christian is one less chinese.‚Äô nobody says that anymore. ... it‚Äôs no longer a foreigner‚Äôs religion; it‚Äôs now something that belongs to the people.‚Äù at the same time, ma yuhong makes clear that the government will still closely watch the ever-shifting line between church and state in today‚Äôs china. ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt make use of religion to interfere in the country‚Äôs administration,‚Äù yuhong says. ‚Äúso if anyone tries to use religion as an excuse to create divisions or to sponsor terrorist activities, that will not be tolerated.‚Äù ""living on the edge‚Äù  for the last year and a half, reporter and producer martin smith has been investigating global climate change for heat, a major two-hour frontline broadcast to air next fall. in ‚Äúliving on the edge,‚Äù smith shares some devastating field notes from this looming environmental catastrophe.  smith begins in the foothills of the himalayas, where nepalese farmers are enjoying surprisingly good farming these days thanks to a disturbingly bad new reality: the glaciers of the himalayas are disappearing faster than ice in any other part of the world. by 2035, scientists tell smith, 80 percent of the glaciers will have disappeared. world-renowned filmmaker and mountaineer david breashears helps smith document the devastation. he shoots the main rongbuk glacier at the foot of mount everest, famously photographed by explorer george mallory in the early part of the twentieth century. ‚Äúi first was on this side of the mountain in 1996,‚Äù breashears tells smith. ‚Äúso i know this place well, and to look at the glacier here in 1921, and to look at it out there now in 2007, the glacier‚Äôs just gone.‚Äù the ripple effect of this change could deal a terrible blow to the hundreds of millions of people currently served by more than 10 major rivers in asia which will no longer be fed by meltwater from himalayan glaciers.  in northwestern kenya, near the sudanese border, smith finds the turkana tribespeople dealing with more frequent droughts, and this, in turn, has led to more tribal fighting over scarce resources. one tribeswoman tells smith: ‚Äúthere used to be much less fighting among our communities, even here in turkana, and around the world. there is a lot of blood being spilled. i blame the fights, all these global wars on the weather changes.‚Äù professor jeffrey sachs, director of columbia university‚Äôs earth institute, says the effects of this long-term decline in rainfall in this part of the world has been devastating. ‚Äúthey've contributed to the massive conflicts in darfur. they've contributed to the instability in somalia. they become security threats for the world, in fact, as well as devastating shocks to these societies themselves.‚Äù  finally, on namibia‚Äôs skeleton coast, smith finds one of the richest sardine fishing grounds in the world practically drying up. though some blame overfishing and poor management of the coastal waters, others think the failing fishing industry here is the result of rapidly warming oceans. ‚Äúit is very unlikely that global warming is the only cause of a lot of things that we're seeing,‚Äù climate scientist joe romm tells smith. ‚Äúbut you get the combination of the temperature change which makes things less hospitable, and then you have the overfishing, so you cross a threshold and you get a collapse. and unfortunately, once you've changed the climate, it becomes very hard to un-collapse. ... it may be that some of these changes are irreversible.‚Äù ""design like you give a damn‚Äù  in the aftermath of 2004‚Äôs devastating indian ocean tsunami, frontline/world reporter singeli agnew discovers a new movement of architects looking to help solve humanitarian problems through innovative design. ‚Äúit was very devastating to hear about the tsunami when it happened,‚Äù architect purnima mccutcheon tells agnew. ‚Äúmost of my career i had been doing large commercial projects and shopping centers. it had always been my aspiration to at some point work with a community and do something more personally meaningful.‚Äù  this is where cameron sinclair and kate stohr come in. the founders of a nonprofit group called architecture for humanity, they help link local communities in need with a network of architects excited at the chance to help. their motto is ‚Äúdesign like you give a damn,‚Äù and they emphasize that the goal is not to produce trophy buildings so much as to create sustainable communities. ‚Äúfor 90 percent of the world, it‚Äôs a matter of survival,‚Äù he says. ‚Äúit‚Äôs life or death. if you‚Äôre not sustainable, then you‚Äôre embedding maintenance into a community that can actually cause great detriment.‚Äù throughout the world, architecture for humanity has designed and helped raise money to build hundreds of projects, and to develop an open source library of innovative design ideas for a clientele that often lives on less than a dollar a day. in the area hard hit by the 2004 tsunami alone, sinclair and architect mccutcheon successfully built 12 different projects, including several new community centers. ‚Äúif there wasn‚Äôt an architect involved, it probably wouldn‚Äôt have got done,‚Äù says sinclair. ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about the design that the architect brings; it‚Äôs about bringing the community together and really kind of visualizing what their dreams and what their needs are to kind of create solutions.‚Äù  stephen talbot is series editor, ken dornstein is senior producer, and sharon tiller is series executive director for frontline/world.

206641,"that's what all kerfuffle this month has been about. mostly just wanted to say thank you and i appreciate everyone here. also i really liked scylla but have to admit, probably more passive then big league.     it's also how they are treating us as mods, visually impaired users, removing all nsfw from 3rd party apps, turning reddit into a greater user data scrapping mechanism, removing the last vestiges of anonymity, it's why a significant % or the subs are still dark, why fidelity cut reddit's valuation again and it's value currently still continues to fall...etc, etc, etc.....  here is what is posted on several subs currently: starting july 1, reddit's api policy will force blind/visually impaired communities to further depend on sighted people for moderation when reddit says they are whitelisting accessibility apps, they are not telling the full story, because apollo, rif, boost, sync, etc. are the apps r/blind users have overwhelmingly listed as their apps of choice with better accessibility, and reddit is not whitelisting them. reddit has done a good job hiding this fact, by inventing the expression ""accessibility apps."" forcing disabled people, especially profoundly disabled people, to stop using the app they depend on and have become accustomed to is cruel; for the most profoundly disabled people, june 30 may be the last day they will be able to access reddit communities that are important to them. if you don't read mod news, and totally understand why the average users doesn't. https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/ reddit abruptly announced that they would be charging astronomically overpriced api fees to 3rd party apps, cutting off mod tools for nsfw subreddits (not just porn subreddits, but subreddits that deal with frank discussions about nsfw topics).  and worse, blind redditors & blind mods [including mods of r/blind and similar communities] will no longer have access to resources that are desperately needed in the disabled community. why does our community care about blind users?  as a mod from r/foodforthought testifies:  i was raised by a 30-year special educator, i have a deaf mother-in-law, sister with ms, and a brother who was born disabled. none vision-impaired, but a range of other disabilities which makes it clear that corporations are all too happy to cut deals (and corners) with the cheapest/most profitable option, slap a ""handicap accessible"" label on it, and ignore the fact that their so-called ""accessible"" solution puts the onus on disabled individuals to struggle through poorly designed layouts, misleading marketing, and baffling management choices. to say it's exhausting and humiliating to struggle through a world that able-bodied people take for granted is putting it lightly.  reddit apparently forgot that blind people exist, https://www.reddit.com/r/blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/ and forgot that reddit's official app (which has had over 9 years of development) and yet, when it comes to accessibility for vision-impaired users, reddit‚Äôs own platforms are inconsistent and unreliable. ranging from poor but tolerable for the average user and mods doing basic maintenance tasks (android) to almost unusable in general (ios). didn't reddit whitelist some ""accessibility apps?""  the ceo of reddit announced that they would be allowing some ""accessible"" apps free api usage: redreader, dystopia, and luna.  there's just one glaring problem: redreader, dystopia, and luna* apps have very basic functionality for vision-impaired users (text-to-voice, magnification, posting, and commenting) but none of them have full moderator functionality, which effectively means that subreddits built for vision-impaired users can't be managed entirely by vision-impaired moderators. https://www.reddit.com/r/blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/  (if that doesn't sound so bad to you, imagine if your favorite hobby subreddit had a mod team that never engaged with that hobby, did not know the terminology for that hobby, and could not participate in that hobby -- because if they participated in that hobby, they could no longer be a moderator.)  then reddit tried to smooth things over with the moderators of r/blind. the results were... messy and unsatisfying, to say the least.  https://www.reddit.com/r/blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/  *special shoutout to luna, which appears to be hustling to incorporate features that will make modding easier but will likely not have those features up and running by the july 1st deadline, when the very disability-friendly apollo app, rif, etc. will cease operations. we see what luna is doing and we appreciate you, but a multimillion dollar company should not have have dumped all of their accessibility problems on what appears to be a one-man mobile app developer. redreader and dystopia have not made any apparent efforts to engage with the r/blind community.  thank you for your time & your patience.",1,,2

615394,"the issue, as i explained in other replies, that while technology can evolve, which is no problem and is a fantastic thing, a fascinating element in fiction to explore (avatar, alien, the fifth element, they live, terminator, etc)  biology and disability do not.   that's not how genetic anomalies work. you cannot breed out a selected gene (hi, eugenics) in your dna. fop has no pattern or family history needed, like other conditions. there's 800 known globally but statistically there's 4,500. fop's earliest recorded dx. was in the 19th century, but scientists have dated evidence to prehistoric times. fop will always exist, and it's nature doesn't change; in this case, your theory that surgery can fix it. surgery is never a treatment for ho in classic fop archetype.   cancer, alzheimer's, fop,  diabetes, autism, everything remains the same as that's the nature of it. we might have cures or better treatments in the future, whether it may be in a year or 800 years, but our dna makeup and illnesses do not mutate.   acvr1 is one in a pair all creatures have, however it is defective that enabled ossification. gene therapy and crispr technology is currently being funded by the ifopa as another cure; cure meaning you are still born with fop, but can deactivate it at birth and prevent ho without stunting normal developmental and puberty growth. they were successful in mice trials. it's not a cure like the traditional sense of erasing an infection, it's not an infection or a parasite.   fop isn't an exclusive human condition, it's been found in cats, dogs, horses, cows, fish, chickens.   laser surgery exists today, as well as 3d printed bone, organs, cultured skin. all of it  still amounts to tissue trauma and a immune response which triggers ho. unless the genetic roadmap eliminates the immune system through evolution to intercept ho, there is no surgery risk free.   the outlook on the new human trials is allowing corrective surgery to remove eligible ho bone post-drug treatment as the drug disables the acvr1 receptor. it would have made sense if your book went that route, or a fictional drug that disabled the immune system instead.   however, the amateur 'why don't you just cut it out' theory is baseless and scientifically proven as a dead end.   the other issue was the evident research garnered from forums like twitter and reddit. bullshit passed around as real facts, for clout. that's harmful and dangerous to the community. it's ableist. if the book was submitted to a medical school paper, it'd be laughed at and rejected, all the facts revealed as mistakes were easily discovered in a 5 seconds google search.   fop is not boneitus (futurama), stoneman syndrome, medusa syndrome, mannequin people, human statues, greyscale. people also think its an erectile dysfunction and troll fop articles and forums making suicide and chronic masturbation disease jokes.   in got, greyscale was based on fop and leprosy,  confirmed by martin. that was a real shitty idea as since then, people think fop is leprosy, and contagious (when most strains of leprosy isn't actually, it's neuropathy and necrosis from neglected wound care).   in fiona's awful horror books rattle and the collector, albeit a real clusterfuck of misinformation and sensationalism compared to your book, she said fop was like a parasite, it was compared to an alien invasion, it controlled her mc's thoughts and body. this wasn't scifi, it's a modern serial killer thriller. she said an fop patient has 'as many years to live as there are letters in its name'. she even had the mc's dad, an identical twin, fopless, but his dead twin had it. that is a hilarious stuff up in understanding genetics and inherited disease.   she had her mc (a child) rip his skin and flesh off with his bare hands and claw at his exposed tendons and bone as the fop flare pain was 'intolerable'. that's just...  ridiculous. stupid. not feasible. not the pain, but ripping your body up like paper, is. describing ho like a leech or worm you can pick out. then not going to hospital and going home with a bandaid all hunky dory. right, ok.   readers took all this as gospel. it's very hard to re-educate and convince them that all that info, was crap.  fop doesn't feel like needles or knives, it never affects the organs or stabs them, it's not a cosmetic condition or a pain-only disability, it's often thought as a strain of arthritis, or absolute agony, online.   pain is honestly 50/50 temperamental, sometimes a flare is totally painless, sometimes it's sore, sometimes it's excruciating, sometimes it's barely noticeable and we dismiss it as a bruise or a bump.   fop side effects/symptoms and complications that we also struggle and fight includes poor immunity, aspiration risk, dental decay, muscle atrophy, deafness, hair loss, scoliosis, kyphosis, susceptible to respiratory and chest infections, heat intolerance, no pregnancy (miscarriage and death for the mother), arthritis, a rare terminal chiild brain stem cancer exclusive to fop, reduced lung capacity, incontinence issues, starvation (jaw and or throat calcified), pressure sores and sepsis.   we can still be afflicted with other conditions like appendicitis, diabetes, flus, covid, rabies, cancer, lupus, cushing's, cerebral palsy, blindness, dementia, blood transfusion need, and so on. it would lead to emergency treatments that without we'd have that illness escalate or we die, like anyone else.   to this day, too many people don't want to come near me, or touch, for fear of catching fop, their ignorant selfdiagnosis stemming from just looking at me and deciding 'ew, that person is infectious, they look different.' people online have admitted to me and other fopers that they thought its a virus, and wounds like papercuts cause it.   (to the naysayers) tell me again how misinformation and no thorough research is harmless.  i hope this helps anyone reading this.",0,,

666350,"i'm a sf/bay area landlord and have been through this multiple times before with tenants.  i'm going to copy and paste my detailed response from a thread in /r/realestate where [we were talking about this](http://www.reddit.com/r/realestate/comments/37lrm7/landlord_to_landlord_lets_discuss_pets/).  it outlines the differences between emotional support animals, therapy dogs and service dogs.    ---------------  take all this with a grain of salt because ianal just a landlord who's been through this a few times in civil court   (edit: and yes, have successfully evicted tenants because they've gotten a puppy without telling me, then when i told them per the terms of their lease they has signed a no pets clause, they go out and get a letter from a doctor and try to pass it off as some sort of service dog/esa).    basically- there are a few different categories of ""service dog"" and they all tend to get lumped together because people (both tenants and landlord) aren't clear about the laws. it's a murky area and i've found even some housing attorneys aren't clear about it. also landlords tend to be in my experience very paranoid about the ada, so the minute someone says ""service dog"" or ""therapy dog"" they back right off and allow the tenant to move in/get the dog. we have a little more leeway than that. just be wary of googling about it because there is a lot of inaccurate information out there about the regulations and a lot of bs on the web about it. there are also a bunch of websites telling people how to fake qualify their dog as a bs service dog and sadly predatory scam places selling fake service dog credentials, harnesses etc for huge markups. it all really sucks for the people who actually need the service dogs, because all this makes landlords hella skeptical of anyone claiming to need a service dog.  **category 1: medical service dog-** dog provides a specific function for a specific disability. so, guide dog for a blind person, seizure alert dog for an epileptic person, hyperglycemic sniffing diabetic alert dog, stability support dog for an amputee, etc.  here is where it gets interesting and where a lot of the confusion comes from- as a housing provider, landlords are allowed to inquire about the nature of the disability and the specific function the dog provides the tenant to alleviate that disability. you can request proof of the disability. this can be a ssdi payment, etc. to warrant a service dog, the person has to qualify as disabled enough to no longer perform normal activities of daily living without the support of the dog. so, a trumped up letter from a doc saying tenant needs fido for his opiate addiction is not going to fly. it has to be a legitimate, verified disability... disabled enough not to perform normal activities of daily living. the dog does not have to be certified through an organization but you can request documentation about the tasks performed by and training of the dog.  what differs from landlords vs someone running a grocery store is because we are a housing provider, hud laws are different than ada laws... so basically if someone says they have a service dog in a restaurant, the restaurant owner can't inquire further, but a housing provider is allowed to request proof/documentation/verification yadda yadda.  another way a landlord can disqualify a bs service dog: even if the tenant has a documented disability and proof of requiring a service dog for a specific function, you can still prevent the dog based on breed restrictions. basically, the ada only requires landlords to allow the dog within ""reasonable accommodation"" and if allowing a service dog pitbull (or whatever breed they want if it's on the breed restricted list) is going to invalidate your building's insurance policy, you are still allowed to reject the disabled tenant and their dog.  so in my case, i was allowed to reject an english bull terrier because they were on my insurance carriers aggressive breed list.  **category ii: emotional support animals** doesn't have to be a dog. can be a cat, parrot, goat, whatever. these are animals whose mere presence helps alleviate mental illness. dogs not trained in any specific way, their function is to help emotional condition of owner. not protected by the ada or hud. this can be a depression dog or a ptsd dog, etc. landlords don't have to allow an emotional support animal.  see more [here](https://adata.org/publication/service-animals-booklet).  **category iii: therapy animals/therapy dog** - these are dogs who are trained to provide therapeutic relief to other people than the owner... so for example if they took the dog and volunteered with it at an alzheimer ward of a skilled nursing facility. dogs are rigorously trained and verified by organizations like the delta society or the spca. not protected by ada or hud, don't have to allow them.  and all this is moot in certain cases...... i'm not saying everyone with a service dog is lying and trying to scam, but there are a lot of people around here who are. if i have a tenant with an actual legitimate disability, i will happily allow the service dog. currently i have two tenants with dogs- a hearing alert corgi for a deaf tenant in one of my properties and a veteran with a ptsd emotional support dog in another... it's more that i can't let every tom dick and harry who wants to get a dog decide to get one then make up some fake disability and try to pass the dog off.  if any lawyers or other landlords with more experience/knowledge about this want to chime in and correct me on anything, feel free!    ----------------------------------------------  as a tenant who wants a pet, the best step is to plead your case and ask your landlord nicely.  if you try to force your landlord to accept a pet via a trumped up note from your doctor, you will make your landlord hate you and they'll be looking to evict you the first chance they can.  having a contentious relationship with your housing provider is not a fun way to live... can lead to stress, health problems, fear of being evicted, worries about litigation, etc.    i love dogs and used to allow them in all my buildings, but unfortunately too many irresponsible idiots ruined it for everyone else by not picking up their poop in the common areas and letting them bark inside of their units all day.",1,,1

420266,"first thing is treat them as a regular human, some people show disgust &amp; make horrible comments so if you don't do that your starting off well. if the disabled person talks then reply to them, not the person with them. realize the person with the disabled person won't always be their carer, they may be their relative or partner. disabled people also have romantic &amp; sexual relationships, which while you don't need to ask about their sex life, for the love of god please don't do that, try to avoid assuming they are single, not married etc.  don't make loads of assumptions in general &amp; believe the disabled person why they tell you something. obviously something like a person in a wheelchair needing to use a lift is an ok assumption but things like wheelchair users who aren't completely paralyzed get accused of faking their disability or just being lazy, obviously that's insulting &amp; ignorant. there are people who are deaf where strangers shout in their ears or deliberately cover their mouth to prevent lip reading to ""test' if the person is actually deaf or not. so not coming in assuming all disabled people are stupid, lie &amp; that you know them better than they do, is great. it might sound like a low bar but it's a really common problem.  if the person is in a wheelchair or is of short stature please don't bend down or kneel, just remain standing &amp; talk regularly. also generally treat disabled adults as adults, people often talk to disabled people like children which is insulting &amp; embarassing. the majority of physically disabled adults are not cognativly affected &amp; have average intelligence; so just treat them like any none disabled adult. however if a disabled adult does have a condition which can affect cognative function like downs syndrome, then they are still a disabled adult, not a child. using more simple language, leaving more time for a reply are all good but adopting a high pitched voice, like how you would talk to a dog, is inappropriate.  if you see someone using a disabled parking space, or another disabled accommodation, but they don't use a wheelchair don't assume that they aren't disabled, so shout at them for lying. apart from many physical disabilities not being obvious at first glance, like cerebral palsy or someone with an amputated leg using a prosthetic, many people have medical conditions which cause them to be disabled. a lot of people with invisible disabilities get treated badly &amp; their suffering is minimised, you can't see heart failure or arthritis but it's symptoms make the person disabled &amp; suffer. so giving people the benifit of the doubt &amp; asking &amp; willing to be educated, rather than thinking you know better is good. just like with able-bodied healthy people not being unplesent, combative &amp; aggressive is good; disabled people often have anxiety, depression etc too, so horrible interactions like that have an even deeper impact, even more so if they have autism or something similar too.  finally i'm not sure how to say it but although you should treat the disabled person with respect &amp; talk to them like a regular person, don't pretend they aren't disabled. if people have disability aids don't go out of the way to pretend they don't exist &amp; not say their name. if people refuse to say the word disabled, wheelchair, crutches etc then it is stigmatizing those things &amp; sounds like you think they are bad, rather than just a fact. going out of your way to avoid descriptors which are less common becomes like the elephant in the room, if you say words related to disability nonchalantly, then it creates a more comfortable atmosphere.  it's a bit more nuanced when it comes to how disabled people prefer to refer to themselves, so asking the person is usually best; howeverowever if your attitude &amp; demeanor is nice then that's the most important thing. so for example just as i say ""i am ginger"" i say ""i am disabled,"" where as some people try to tell me i'm wrong &amp; should say i'm ""a person with a disability"" but just as i wouldn't pointedly say ""a person with ginger hair"" i won't refer to my disability in that way. disabled people feel differently about person/identity first language but in my experience it's often able bodied professionals pushing for people to use person first language, as if saying you have to distance the disability from the person to be able to respect them &amp; treat them well, which is ridiculous imo. also the majority of autistic people prefer identify first language. people's opinions on descriptors like special needs, handicapped etc vary but generally handicap-able, differently-abled &amp; other similar terms are generally unpopular amongst actually disabled people. personally i think it sounds condacending &amp; tbh inaccurate, the whole point is i am not as capable as the average person, that is why i'm disabled! if people think that disabled people are capable of absolutely nothing then that's the issue that they need to address &amp; work on, not change the language to make themselves feel better. so if you note how the disabled person refers to themselves, or their disabled child, then try to make an effort to use the same terminology. however if you don't try to correct them &amp; lecture them on why what  descriptors they like to use is wrong, then that will be greatly appreciated. also as i said the general attitude &amp; positive communication will be a bigger indicator of how you feel than your language (assuming you aren't hurling insults &amp; swearing obviously!) general acknowledgement of a disabled persons existence, replying to direct questions &amp; interacting like a normal human, instead of an animal, will all be better than how a lot of people react.",1,,2
151228,"&gt; because they literally are two teachers.  two teachers who cannot be in two different places at the same time and have serious limitations on their ability to work on two individual tasks at the same time.  &gt;let's say they weren't conjoined, just severely disabled in another fashion, and produced the same amount of work each that they are doing now. work that their employers are satisfied with. would you be arguing that because they were disabled and thus they were only 'doing the work of 'half' an able bodied person' that they should be paid less than an able bodied person?  &gt;so again, if their disability wasn't their being conjoined but something else - say, they were completely blind, or deaf, or quadraplegic, or had some other severe disability that limited each of them to only the same amount of individual work they can do now, you are saying they shouldn't be paid as much as an able-bodied teacher because they are disabled?  yes.    &gt;so, ipso facto, do you believe disabled people should be paid less than able bodied people for the same positions because they are disabled?  if the disabled person cannot do the same essential job duties as the able-bodied person then yes.  if a disabled person can only do 60% of the job duties that an able-bodied person can, they deserve 60% of the salary.    i'm trying to come up with an example here that doesn't feel completely artificial.  let's say a company is hiring someone to work in their shipping department.  half the job is packaging up orders and half of it is delivering them using the company vehicle.  let's say someone with epilepsy applies for the job.  they've got a great resume for the packaging orders part, but because of their disability, they can't legally drive so they can't do the deliveries.  the company decides to hire them anyway, because the labor market is tough and they have a great resume.  the company does not owe them 100% of the advertised salary because they cannot do 100% of the necessary duties.  the company owes them 50% of the advertised salary for the 50% of the duties they can do.  the hensel twins are not doing the job duties of two teachers.  the job duties of two teachers almost always involve being in two different places at once teaching two different classes (in the case of separate teachers in separate classrooms) or doing two different tasks at once with different students (in the case of teaching aids or specialty teachers who might be in the same classroom as another teacher.  it is almost unheard of for a district to have two full-time teachers in the same classroom 100% of the time like the hensel twins are.",1,,0

661787,"i'm curious to know your thoughts on the following train of thought.  apologies in advance as this is sort of a random tangent, perhaps even a ridiculous intellectual exercise ....  if we were created by god, and man and women were designed by god to create children and expand, as you allude to in another response, why is the process of actually creating our own children so stunningly unreliable (infertility, still births, miscarriages), prone to error (genetic defects), and disproportionally risky for the woman involved?  clearly, on the whole, the process of reproduction that we have has been effective enough to arguably overpopulate the planet.  however, the process itself does not exactly seem to be divinely inspired or designed.  i have a technical background, and i would say that our reproductive methods and processes are the equivalent to a system that is designed and operated on a ""best effort"" basis -- that is, reproduction works properly, most of the time, for most people -- but there is no guarantee!   we have this system of reproduction, and it is good enough, but not perfect.  but man and woman were designed in the image of god.  clearly, god gave some consideration to this reproduction thing, as men and women clearly have complimentary private parts.  but, the whole system just seems like it could be ... optimized.  and it's not even just a matter of the pain of childbirth.  it's the fact that often enough, the outcome of our attempts at creation are nil, or children who suffer from some minor or major  congenital or genetic defect, or a mother who is seriously injured or ends up dieing from the actual birthing process.  and then, what happens when our creation process goes wrong?  who is to blame when there is a child born with a genetic defect?  a child who becomes a cripple due to the trauma of the birthing process?  the child suffers.  the family of this child suffers.  how do we explain suffering that is the direct result of this imperfect creation process that we are designed by god to engage in?  theologically, suffering is often attributed to free will.  however, it's my understanding that this is most often applied to situations where someone was able to knowingly make a choice and then simply has to suffer the consequences of it.   the child born with this major defect or disability had no choice in this process, thus we cannot blame the infant for being created imperfectly.  so then we do we say that the free will here was that the parents decided to have a child, that they decided to enter into this process with some level of understanding that creating a child is an imperfect process and the outcome is not always a desired one?  or, do we look to god, our own creator, and the architect of our creation process and wonder why is this process so flawed?  why did a perfect god design such an imperfect system?    i'm also well aware of the typical theological notion that much of the brokenness in the world, in general, and in this case the imperfection in our own creation process is simply fall out from original sin.  and theologically, maybe that's really the only answer -- that this just is, and before the fall, our ability to create and reproduce was so much more full and complete.  if so, damn the mythical adam and eve.  i wish i was able to further deconstruct my line of thinking for you, because i do understand that there's a confluence of a few different things mushed into a big ""wtf!?!?""""  so, instead, i'll give you a little personal background -- my wife and i suffer from ""unspecified"" infertility, and i have two siblings who are profoundly disabled -- one has down's syndrome and the other is a spastic quadriplegic due to hypoxia during the birthing process.    really, i understand that everyone has shitty things in life - their ""lot"" in life.  but i have a heck of a hard time understanding the shitty things that just are, and seemingly have no real rhyme or reason.    instead, i'm left to ask ""wtf, god?""",1,,-1

341288,"yes! yes, it is! what other lens do you expect the deaf community to look at it through, given that they have been mistreated, historically, just as much as racial minorities, and sometimes in even worse ways. a hundred years ago, the disabled were more likely to be targeted by eugenics programs than  racial minorities, whether that was the deaf, the mute, or the mentally handicapped. most people didn't want to exterminate blacks or jews, at least provided that we could somehow get them out of our societies. even though society has changed, deaf culture is still young and bears the stories of those things more strongly than the non-deaf culture around them. to the deaf culture, our attempts to reverse, cure, or heal hearing loss or deafness feel the same as if we were trying to cure dark-skinnedness.  now that i've shared the deaf perspective, without using that to chime in my own thoughts on the issue, let me take a moment to share my thoughts. i want to preface these thoughts by saying that i do live with adhd, and what i say here applies as equally towards any disability as it does towards the specific case of deafness:  i believe that it should be the choice of a child's parents whether a surgery to grant or increase sensory functions of a child is performed. i believe (in turn) that the disability community should have no pressuring influence over this choice, while recognizing that it does.  i believe that a parent deciding they want to reduce the disability of their child is a positive and beneficial choice, and that nobody should ever judge a parent poorly for wishing their child might have even a slightly better life than themselves. i do, however, recognize that they will be judged, especially if they belong to an insular community, for wanting to have their children outside of it in any way.  i believe that an individual deciding to reduce their disability of their own volition is an equally positive and beneficial choice, and i believe that the deaf community has a very unpleasant attitude about anybody who is _not deaf enough_ for any reason. their attitude is bad, but that does not mean it is invalid.   i believe that i would struggle to choose whether or not my own children should be treated to reduce or neutralize adhd in them. however, as a normally-sensing parent, if i were made aware of a surgery to grant hearing or sight or speech to my sensory disabled child, i would not struggle nearly as much. i would want my child to have a better life than me, and i would definitely struggle to believe they could do that if they were deaf or blind or mute, but i would be far more inclined to believe that proper treatment of adhd could help them achieve a better life than mine and thus more reluctant to submit them to a surgery or treatment that might _cure_ them of adhd.  i, like you, am grateful for medication that helps me regulate (in my case) my focus and initiative. i am glad we have medical options that allow people with disabilities to function in a more normal manner without always eliminating their disabilities and changing who the person feels like they are. however, i know some of the struggles these communities face and have faced, and how there can be just as much stigma from a disabled community over getting treatment as there is from the non-disabled community over avoiding treatment.",1,,1

738027,"yeah -- i understand. just changing a character name can be a wrench -- hurting them for anything in what you're trying to show feels cruel. when i say held me back, it's internal rather than external. with all the support and understanding i genuinely get now for mental health and that my husband gets for his cancer, it's still in and of itself an internal limitation. disability isn't just cosmetic -- it's real and internal. other people can make life easier for you, they can help you rather than see you as an object of pity or derision, and you can adapt to being in certain situations, but the problem still remains and i feel it as an internal handicap rather than a lack of external support.  look up spoon theory -- my husband has wrestled with that since his diagnosis. the theory goes that an able-bodied/well person has infinite 'spoons' -- an arbitrary unit of measurement based on the person explaining the theory being in a restaurant -- and is able to cope with anything. people with certain disabilities or illnesses have limited spoons: they have finite resources of energy and not only have to apportion them out over the day to do the things they want to do and have to do, but have to reserve some to deal with a crisis.   in my case, my spoons aren't infinite, but the number is very large. a lot are used up by my husband being ill, so i have less than what is necessary to sustain normal life. at times like christmas, i'm using many more spoons, and to add to the burden my aspergers and anxiety latch on to party politics in the uk, and things have hit the roof recently :d with this stupid brexit crisis. (think carrie in *homeland*, but without the job in the secret service.)  also maybe look at the chapters about jaime from asoiaf. many disabilities are hereditary or people are born with them, but a lot simply happen to people through accidents, serious illnesses such as cancer and so on. people who are born blind have usually adapted and never known anything else. people who go blind probably miss having their sight, and although some born-blind or born-deaf people feel that their disability gives them a different perspective on life, almost like a gender or racial identity, people who suffer a life-altering illness or accident later in life take a long time to adjust (my husband was diagnosed 15 months ago and still hasn't come to terms with his condition).   then there's people like me who were born with mental handicaps (i was actually born asleep and had to be woken up; my mum always explained it as just giving me a puff of oxygen to get me going, but my dad remembers it as a full-scale medical intervention; we're also relatively certain i have dyspraxia but it wasn't a 'thing' when i was a child and could have benefitted from a diagnosis), but still find their incapacities come from within rather than without.   also remember advances in medical science have rendered many diseases curable. put it this way: twelve years ago a family friend, damien, died of a similar cancer to what my husband has. damien wasn't diagnosed as quickly as my hubby was, but he was actually a researcher at a lab working on the drugs my husband is taking now. d reckoned he would have benefitted from those pills -- but he developed his disease two or three years too early even for trials. even now, the drug my hubby is on is still at the stage of testing different doses to see which level gives the right effect for the right cost in terms of side effects. although my hubby is through the worst (an ineffective treatment caused a brain lesion that could be removed, but cost him six months off work and a lot of anxiety and chaos and stress etc) he is still badly shaken and depressed because in three years he's gone from a healthy young man with a keen interest in sports to a wreck and who's contemplating selling off his cricket kit because he can't stand up for very long without fatigue setting in.  so yeah. to mean anything, disability has to be just that -- anything from a condition that makes it harder to adjust to life, particularly in a society which isn't as advanced as ours in terms of attitude and accommodation, to something that wrecks physical ability and triggers profound depression and frustration. i liked the way jaime lannister was portrayed because although war wounds are going to be very common in a martial society, and probably understood a lot better than something like cancer or autism, that doesn't mean he doesn't feel the loss of his sword-hand keenly in himself. he was shown as having to relearn everything with his left hand, and that's kinda what it's like for many people who acquire disabilities.   battles matter as well. my friend, who is a keen crafter and has fibromyalgia lost the use of one hand for a while 18 months ago; she didn't know whether it was going to be permanent or not. when she finally recovered this spring, she knit herself a kaftan just because she could, to stick two fingers up to her physical handicap. it's an achievement for me to be at work while the political storm rages outside. after ten years of sick leave i finally managed to overcome that anxiety and hold down a job. i'm not where i should be -- i have a degree and a masters and work on reception -- but i have a job that i love and which doesn't stress me too much, feel supported by others and i find that i can switch my political brain off from  time to time, whereas for about six years out of my most decade i was 'always on'. (it took about 18 months playing world of warcraft to distance myself from that state, then i went back to uni to do a masters in ...political law.)  combatting ableism is the outside situation -- the way society understands disability and makes accommodation for issues. but all the paid sick leave, crisis hotlines, cancer awareness, people not using the word 'spaz' (a word which has disappeared here because of its roots in ableism towards those with cerebral palsy and other brain disorders) and so on don't make up for the personal crippling of a dyspraxic mind or a grand mal seizure at 2 in the morning. my aunt is coeliac and a caterer and finds it really hard when she smells freshly-baked bread and then (up until recently when gluten-free bread and so on became a thing) had to eat rice-cakes. just because you've lived with it all your life and mostly adapted to it doesn't make it *effing* hard sometimes.  it's not just an identity; it's something very real and very internal and it makes life hell. *homeland* portrayed carrie's bipolar condition extremely well. it handicapped her, but not only in the eyes of her colleagues -- in her ability to act rationally and still put her brilliant mind to work. i'd love to be able to do that but my condition gets in the way of putting my mental resources to better use.  you have to hurt your characters. but showing them being frustrated by their disability will, i promise, tell people like us we're not alone.",1,,2

648702,"&gt; i wouldn't even call it a mental illness, given that there is a movement among the members of that community - just like there has been in the deaf community - to try to get us to accept it as a normal but unique way to relate to the world.  why? i think the autism community wants to move away from calling it a mental illness because there's a stigma around the term ""mental illness"", but the real problem here is the stigma and not the classification. the stigma of being diagnosed with a mental illness is a separate issue from the very real and true fact that:  &gt;a brain development disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior  meets the qualification of   &gt; a psychological or behavioral pattern that occurs in an individual and is thought to cause distress or disability that is not expected as part of normal development or culture  granted, i agree that there's no reason to treat the mentally ill with such stigma (it's obviously something they're not capable of controlling), but to try and change the facts simply because the autistic community doesn't enjoy being ostracized because people are unable to cope with the mentally ill is dishonest and simply false.   &gt; one has to first of all define what an impulse is  here you are:  &gt;urge: an instinctive motive  &gt;humans have certain desires to do things - and they ought to be wise in how they approach the task of fulfilling their goals.  yes, that's exactly my point. most humans have, at some point in their lives, had a desire to do something inappropriate such as strike another person who's aggravating them. we're largely capable of controlling these desires, because we understand that violence isn't a part of appropriate social interaction.   that doesn't mean i think all autistic children are ticking time bombs, or that all adults are well-behaved individuals. but it's ignorant and dangerous to assume we shouldn't be more mindful of individuals with a disease characterized by:  &gt; impaired social interaction and communication  especially in light of the fact that an impaired communicative ability means they're sometimes unable to voice their frustration adequately.  &gt;i think that people who live in a rigid structure throughout their childhood and youth tend to act out childishly because they are treated as children - even as they get older. they aren't given the opportunities to socially mature. they don't have a proper adolescence; they don't have the opportunity to learn how to act as an adult among adults. i've seen this more among those with cerebral palsy. autistic folks seem to have enough opportunities to grow up socially, it seems to me.  &gt;the upshot, however, is that if a person is given the role of a child... and all of his decisions are made for him... then that person might very well frequently act out as a child would in that situation - because that person has the same need to manuever around and affect the social politics of the environment that a child has.  yes, there's a well-known sociological theory called ""labeling theory"" describing exactly what you've said here.  that means nothing to the individual who has to deal with an autistic adult, however. in fact, i'm not even arguing with you that society needs to treat the mentally ill differently: we do. there's a large stigma regarding the mentally ill which still persists, and much of society could stand from education regarding mental illnesses.  that doesn't mean we need to whitewash the diagnosis of autism because the public reacts in a negative way that the autistic community doesn't approve of.  &gt; certainly, people like schizophrenics are known to act out physically in relation to their imaginary world. they may flutter their eyes, or they may walk in circles. but those actions do not mean that they are oblivious to hazards around them, or ways in which they might cause harm around them.  schizophrenics have an abnormal perception of reality. if your perception is abnormal, you may in fact be incapable of distinguishing between what's real and what's not - especially if your brain function is abnormal.   i can tell you from personal experience my aunt is a diagnosed schizophrenic who threatened my grandmother with a knife because she believed my grandmother was trying to kill her by poisoning her cereal: this is actually how they came to realize she was suffering from schizophrenia.   the point of medicine isn't to gloss over facts you find disconcerting or unappealing: it's diagnosis and treatment, even if the treatment is simply learning how to cope with a disease. society's reaction to that disease should not have even the slightest effect on the medical knowledge regarding that disease.",1,,-1

355721,">andrechrome  adrenochrome is a chemical compound produced by the oxidation of adrenaline (epinephrine). it was the subject of limited research from the 1950s through to the 1970s as a potential cause of schizophrenia. while it has no current medical application, the related derivative compound, carbazochrome, is a hemostatic medication.  &#x200b;  despite this compound's name, it is unrelated to the element chromium; instead, the ‚Äëchrome suffix indicates a relationship to color, as pure adrenochrome is deep violet.\[1\]  chemistry  &#x200b;  the oxidation reaction that converts adrenaline into adrenochrome occurs both in vivo and in vitro. silver oxide (ag2o) was among the first reagents employed for this,\[2\] but a variety of other oxidising agents have been used successfully.\[3\] in solution, adrenochrome is pink and further oxidation of the compound causes it to polymerize into brown or black melanin compounds.\[4\]  history  an adrenochrome ampoule  &#x200b;  several small-scale studies (involving 15 or fewer test subjects) conducted in the 1950s and 1960s reported that adrenochrome triggered psychotic reactions such as thought disorder and derealization.\[5\]  &#x200b;  in 1954, researchers abram hoffer and humphry osmond claimed that adrenochrome is a neurotoxic, psychotomimetic substance and may play a role in schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.\[6\]  &#x200b;  in what hoffer called the ""adrenochrome hypothesis"",\[7\] he and osmond in 1967 speculated that megadoses of vitamin c and niacin could cure schizophrenia by reducing brain adrenochrome.\[8\]\[9\]  &#x200b;  the treatment of schizophrenia with such potent anti-oxidants is highly contested. in 1973, the american psychiatric association reported methodological flaws in hoffer's work on niacin as a schizophrenia treatment and referred to follow-up studies that did not confirm any benefits of the treatment.\[10\] multiple additional studies in the united states,\[11\] canada,\[12\] and australia\[13\] similarly failed to find benefits of megavitamin therapy to treat schizophrenia.  &#x200b;  the adrenochrome theory of schizophrenia waned, despite some evidence that it may be psychotomimetic, as adrenochrome was not detectable in people with schizophrenia.\[citation needed\]  &#x200b;  in the early 2000s, interest was renewed by the discovery that adrenochrome may be produced normally as an intermediate in the formation of neuromelanin.\[5\] this finding may be significant because adrenochrome is detoxified at least partially by glutathione-s-transferase. some studies have found genetic defects in the gene for this enzyme.\[14\]  &#x200b;  adrenochrome is also believed to have cardiotoxic properties.\[15\]\[16\]  in popular culture  &#x200b;  in his 1954 book the doors of perception, aldous huxley mentioned the discovery and the alleged effects of adrenochrome which he likened to the symptom",0,,

118053,"what /u/_ataraxia said, but you can get or train a psychiatric service dog if your depression is disabling. the definition of disabled under us law is as follows:  &gt; an individual is considered to have a ""disability"" if s/he has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment. persons discriminated against because they have a known association or relationship with an individual with a disability also are protected. the first part of the definition makes clear that the ada applies to persons who have impairments and that these must substantially limit major life activities.  there are two non-exhaustive lists of examples of major life activities: caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, sitting, reaching, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, interacting with others, and working. major life activities also include the operation of major bodily functions, including: the immune system; special sense organs and skin; normal cell growth; and digestive, genitourinary, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, cardiovascular, endocrine, hemic, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, and reproductive functions. examples of specific impairments that should easily be concluded to be disabilities include: deafness, blindness, intellectual disability, partially or completely missing limbs, mobility impairments, autism, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, hiv infection, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. the second part of the definition protecting individuals with a record of a disability would cover, for example, a person who has recovered from cancer or mental illness.  source: http://adata.org/publication/ada-faq-booklet",1,,0

218189,"i was hoping someone here would say something about the disabilities. i know this will get burried but i just wanted to say how immaculately they handled it.  they did an amazing job at avoiding all the pitfalls and stereotypes that are so often drug out every time disabilities are portrayed in media.  firstly, they managed to avoid the blind wise person trope. when blind people are shown in film they're often either portrayed as some sort of prophet/portal to the supernatural or some sort of wiseman. toph is none of that. she's not spiritual or particularly mature, let alone wise. she's a stubborn young teenager much like any other teenager. hurray avoiding the wiseman film trope.  they also managed to avoid the ""inspiration porn"" trope. this is one of the most popular pieces of shit in the disability world. everybody loves to hear about how ""this man did a triathlon with no arms no legs, has cancer, is blind, deaf, paralyzed and with diabetes! the only disability is a bad attitude!!!!"" toph is a resourceful young lady that adapts her bending to her physical abilities but at no point do the creators try to make the case ""if this blind girl can fight, you can achieve anything you want!!!"" which is incredibly refreshing and atypical compared to how most shows portray disabilities.  they also avoided the ""supercrip"" stereotype. the perfect example of this i can think of is almost every character in the marvel universe. there have plenty of characters with disabilities, but they're not very disabled by them. for example, tony stark has anxiety/ptsd but that doesn't stop him from routinely waltzing through explosions and ripping up the night life. he might occasionally have a panic attack, hut on the whole he just goes about his life as a billionaire with hardly any barbiturates or any tics from his anxiety (you'd think he'd at least have trichotillomania or something). professor x and daredevil are also super crips, they both have disabilities but their disabilities don't really prevent them from doing much (aside from maybe not being able to tell what bottle the ketchup is in or something  small and humorous). toph on the other hand, routinely has issues. she's an excellent fighter, but she has a deep set self esteem problem due to not knowing what she looks like. she also can't read, which gets her left out of adventures the other children do (she volunteered to stay out of the library, but only because she couldn't get any enjoyment out of the books), she can't even hang up fucking posters by herself. she basically has to follow everyone else around and do nothing while they're productive (which judging how she slams a poster face down on a wall pisses her off). she's also lost if she can't stand on earth, flying on appa actively makes her uncomfortable and the one time she had to walk on ice she was terrified. tophs disability actively shapes her life unlike how many other characters disabilities do. toph has a true disability, not just a mild inconvenience.  something that's less of a trope but is also something that i adore about alab is is shows how toph truly customizes her bending to fit her abilities. she doesn't just earthbend while blind she's developed an entirely different system that fits her. ""normal"" earth bending is based on hung gar, tophs bending is based on praying mantis kung fu. i think many ""normal"" people don't realize how different disabled people have to do things and i think that tophs style is an elegant portrayal of that. toph has truly tsken her bending and made it her own. she moves differently, she reacts differently and she attacks differenly than anyone else in the avatar world (that we know of). this is something that inspires me as a disabled martial artist, but in addition to that i find it a useful way to portray disability in our world. every day i see people trip over themselves to open the door for me because they see my wheelchair and assume i cant do it. i can open doors just fine, i just do it differently than you. no one would say that toph can't fight because she's blind, or that she couldnt pour her own drink because she's blind, clearly she just skins the cat a different way. i want to plaster this idea on billboards all over the us.  last thing because it's my bedtime, i also love the portrayal of tophs parents. from my experience, almost all parents of disabled children fight the urge to over protect like that. i appreciate the shot of realism it gives to the show.  tl/dr avatar is the best show ever.",1,,2
834897,"sorry for the typos, i've been dealing with health issues, sorry for jumbled thoughts as well.   nta  hi op,    i grew up in a situation similar to this.  i am the second child.  my older sister was born severely disabled, with cerebral palsy.  she functions as a toddler. she will be 50 this year.  she is also a spastic quadriplegic.  i spent 35 years of my life caring for her, at the detriment of my health because my parents began their lives with my sister as  your husband is doing with your precious daughter.  my parents were both doting parents to my sister.  my father more so.  he felt very bad that my sister was so severely disabled, and he tried to do everything he could to make it up to her.  he never disciplined her. he did everything she wanted. he would move heaven and earth to do anything he could for her.    he made her fiercely dependent on him. this dependence made her very viscous to my mother, my younger sister, and myself if we tried to make her do something we knew she was capable of doing on her own that her daddy would flat out give her.  she would physically attack us.  i used to wear long sleeves in school because i was ashamed at how scarred my arms were from her scratching and clawing me with her fingernails, which went unpunished, because she was handicapped.    our parents let her sleep in their bed, until she was like 8 or so.  she had a bed of her own, but she would often wake up nights fussing, and as i said she is still mentally a toddler. dad couldn't tolerate that. my mom was ok with her sleeping in their bed at first, but my mom slowly felt as though she was getting pushed out of my dad's life.  so my mom went on a huge diet and lost over 100lbs.  my sister went to sleep in her own room about that time, but my dad was still catering to my sister's every need, want, and desire.  he was doing more and more to make her the only thing in his world.  she had a seizure and lo and behold she was back in my parents bed again, because they couldn't risk her having another seizure and dying on them.  they would have knock down drag out fights over her care, and how my dad was making her too dependent which is the exact opposite of what she needed to be.  finally, my mother got sick of it all, and took off.  i was 10 at the time.  she took my younger sister with her, leaving me, my older sister, and my dad.  i had to learn really fast how to do housework, cook, clean, and take care of my older sister whilst my dad was at work.  my grandma helped when she could, but i was totally overwhelmed.  i had a debilitating back injury by the time i was 9 and was declared totally disabled by the time i was 19.  no one decided outside care was warranted until there was a cps case opened against my parents for abuse against my older sister.  which was rich, because she was the only one of the 3 of us kids not getting abused, and most of the abuse was meted out by her, i might add.    taking care of someone with special needs is often overwhelming.  you cannot waive discipline in favor of the heartbreak you feel for your child being disabled, anymore than you can sit back and worry that something bad is going to happen, on the possibility their condition worsens. you face many decisions with your daughter's care, and should you at some point have other children, with their care and upbringing too. make good memories together, so that everyone looks back and can smile no matter their condition.  my dad passed recently and my mother a dozen years prior to that.  i keep hearing my husband talk of the great trips he and his family took when he was younger.  all the places they went and things they did.  i don't have those memories with either of my parents or my family, and not just because they split up.  we never went anywhere because of my sister's disabilities, her lack of discipline, her screaming and throwing things when she didn't get her way. our parent's wouldn't take us anywhere because they didn't want to punish any other families by having to deal with the screaming and carrying on.  with the thrown toys, etc.  i know it's easier said than done, but try and make your daughter the most well adjusted kid despite her ailments and issues, that is the best gift you can possibly give her.  i advise both you and your husband to get therapy, both separately and together.  raising someone with disabilities is difficult. avail yourself of all the services available to you.  therapy for your child, respite services if they are available so that you and your husband can get away together without your daughter for a night or a weekend just to refresh and renew your bond, estate planning, elder care, etc.  i don't know what your daughter is capable of, because she's still young. having both parents healthy to love and support her will be so beneficial to her as she grows.   sadly, my sister will only ever function as a toddler mentally,  she was placed into a group home on her 40th birthday after decades of my being told she would be raped and abused if she was ever put in one and that it was my duty to care for her.  i am happy to report that my sister has never been better. her needs are better met than they ever were living at home.  she is happier than she's ever been.  she's sleeping in her own bed, in her own room, with people who love and care for and spoil her rotten.  she has everything my father tried to do for her.  but, unlike they way my parent's treated her, the staff at her home make her do things for herself, and they give her tough love.  they let her cry things out in her room if she's fussing not hold her until she quiets down. they take away anything she can break and they let her be by herself until she's calmed down.  they work with behavior experts and therapists and such to do what is best for her so that she is in the best possible environment for her and for her housemates and the staff that work with her. had my parents been open to options sooner, maybe we all could have had happier lives a lot sooner.  i am glad she finally got the help that she needs. the same year she was put into a group home, i had to get back surgery for my long standing back issues related to her care. i am now permanently in a wheelchair. now, just have to pick up what is left of the mess my parents left  with all of their good intentions in caring for her entirely by themselves.  since both of my parents are now deceased, i am left with the legal battles related to overseeing my sister's care and picking up the pieces of my own health as a paraplegic with crps and a litany of other issues. having to care for my sister made me very depressed and suicidal for a long time.  i am thankfully in a better place

709682,"&gt; you're not the one that gets to decide if we're happy in spite of something.  i just want to clarify this before i go further: i don't want this to be an 'us vs them' discussion. we are people talking about other people, and i'd like to keep the conversation moving in that sort of direction. as i said, i'm open to changing my opinion, but if that's to happen, we can't presume that the conversation must be so binary.   &gt; trust me when i say the deaf community would really disagree with you on that topic.  as i've said, i'm very familiar with this topic. i understand that many deaf people are against hearing aids in order to preserve their culture. i also know that some are against any deaf person getting an aid, and i know that children who cannot hear are absolutely overwhelmed with joy when they are able to hear clearly for the first time (the same goes with sight). i'm happy that they're happy, but by definition, something is missing. they might not need it to be happy, and they might need it at all. that doesn't change that something is missing.   &gt; i know it very well, i know how to take care of it, and i don't think i necessarily would were i non-disabled.  it's fortunate that you can say this. not everyone can.   &gt; the thing about ""ignorance"" is we could say the same about non-disabled people, you're ignorant of the positives things in our lives - and just assume that we must be worse off because we are disabled in some way and that disability must be inherantly negative.  i've never said that the lives of disabled people are inherently negative. i do think that they are worse off in some ways. perhaps a deaf person gets joy from a community they wouldn't have had if they could hear. that doesn't change their biological state. i've also never said that there are no positive things in the lives of disabled people. i've acknowledged this several times, and hope i needn't do so continuously.   &gt; if you agree that no one is truly normal, but then still say things are missing, you're still ascribing in some way to an idea that something is normal - because if nothing was normal than things that aren't present wouldn't be able to be described as missing.  i was once told that the difference between someone with obsessive compulsive tendencies and ocd is how much this affects their life. everyone has symptoms of some sort of mental condition, to an extent. some are extremely minor, others are more prominent, but for the most part, they aren't debilitating or causing a large strain on their lives. my point is that we know what a normal, healthy person would appear as, and it's a framework to see what people are like. there are margins here, such as hair color or personality, but there's a general idea. if we knock off an arm or a leg, however, it's pretty easy to say that this is not the correct state of a human being.   &gt; it's the whole idea that ""it's great that they're happy as they are"" it's really condescending  it's unfortunate that you interpreted my genuine statement so negatively. what i meant was that i'm genuinely happy for them. as lame as this may sound, i'm happy for anyone who has found happiness for themselves. the state of their health, mental or physical, has no bearing on this.   &gt; again you're not us, so you don't get to decide that.   i have epilepsy. am i still one of 'them' now, or can i be on your side. do my words somehow have more credence? or perhaps this bears nothing on my argument.   i don't care for the divisive tone this conversation seems to be taking. we are two people having a discussion, and hopefully each of us will contribute something and take something away, even if it's just what other people think about an issue. it doesn't need to be an 'us vs them' type of thing.    &gt; we should be trusted to know our own minds.  if you think it's fair game to say that 'us' non-disabled people can't understand your position, then this point is invalid, as you cannot compare your position to that of a non-disabled person. as someone who can see, i can tell you that i would eventually be able to manage without vision, but knowing what i'm missing, it would suck, and most people who have lost their ability to see still miss their vision.   i'm just going to address your last 2 paragraphs as a whole; it's easier than quoting a whole bunch of separate chunks.   while i understand what implication a disabled person may derive from the term ""disabled,"" i'm still not sure i defend the need for a change in language. part of me is fine with changing terms in order to comfort others. it's almost like preferred pronouns in that sense. on the other hand, i find it almost condescending in and of itself. we used to call people who couldn't walk 'cripples.' it was a fine word. then, it became the wrong word to use. then it became 'the disabled.' that was alright too. a little while ago they tried for 'differently abled' and that didn't really hold, but now it seems 'people with disabilities.' i just feel like it's condescending to need to cater to this sort of thing. changing what we call something doesn't change what it is, and while the language we use does have some effect on our thoughts, i don't know that there's substantial reason to believe calling 'them' 'people with disabilities' will cause people to treat them better.   as i've said before and i shall once more repeat, i don't think that being disabled (or not) has any impact on your happiness. i don't even think of it as a relevant factor. i think it's a difficulty, but that's pretty much it from an emotional standpoint. if you are happy with who you are, it doesn't matter whether or not you are disabled. that said, non-disabled people by definition have something that people with disabilities do not, and i can't think of a single case (generally speaking) where those with disabilities specifically benefit from them.",1,,1

""handicapable"" could actually be far more offensive than calling someone a cripple depending on context.  look at all the words related to mental capacity. we weaponize words, make up a new word/phrase, and it just inherits the same stigma as the last. i dont see the point.  i am quite literally both lame and partially blind(no peripheral vision on my left side). if i would describe myself as lame the language police would come for me.  *er uh not lame but person with a mobility related disability pertaining to an extremity that facilitates bipedal locomotion!  lived experiences become relevant in some weird mental gymnastics. if you differ from the narrative you're automatically ablest.  if you have the condition you are describing its called internalised ableism the minute people dont like what you have to say.   people start conflating things with eugenics an euthanasia etc.  in my case its like calm the fuck down.i'm saying none of those things. touch grass/see a therapist.  oh no! not all people can touch grass. idioms/colloquialisms are ablist violence!  is my life ""less than"" it used to be? it absolutely fucking is and anyone that says otherwise can go fuck themselves.  thats a me thing. if someone who shares my health problems does not feel that way i have no issues with that.  queue ""you're not disabled its the world that is wrong""  hey i dont like it either and i'm a fan of accessibility etc but when catalogs of material are removed for lacking closed captioning or content is just not created, who was really helped?  with my mobility impairments and visual impairments *nobody* wants to pay for a world where my impairments are a non issue, and that includes disabled people imo.  i'm not going to perform some elaborate dance pretending my life is peachy. i wish people would stop trying to force me to do so  i experience many of my impairments as a subtraction, as something i used to be able to do. that *really* irritates some people and makes me wrong i guess.  do i find myself wondering how my life would have been different/less painful if i wasn't on the spectrum? yep.",1,-2,0
467303,"no, i can‚Äôt. i just know there is light and dark. as in, it‚Äôs light out there, the sun is out and i can see it. likewise, it‚Äôs lighted in here, the light is on or there is no light in here. but this light is not useful. during the night i don‚Äôt turn on the lights. it‚Äôs not helpful, i don‚Äôt need it.  being deaf is another ball park, but i guess i don‚Äôt feel sorry for them either. i find deafness to be pretty interesting though.i‚Äôve met some successful deaf people, including a very good professor of mine and has a family. he‚Äôd probably tell you it‚Äôs not a big deal to him either. i know a few blind and deaf people, and some of them can be pretty successful. i know one who has implants and functions fairly ell, i believe he‚Äôs studying to be a systems admin.  it‚Äôs interesting, if you ask the federal government, which is a worse disability we supposedly are. blind people are considered more disabled than any other disability, because people deem just that much of the world is dependent on sight. this is true and not true. i think with so much technology out there and other innovative solutions one can master life.  the horrible myth that once you lose your vision, you‚Äôre a piece of meat or something, completely useless, it‚Äôs a horrible existence, you become incapable, is just that! a myth. a pretty sad one, that which the blindness community sometimes encourages and does relative little to discourage. i think the issue is these communities focus too much on these issues honestly, and one that is encouraged by people who work with the blind or disabled. i‚Äôve found more support honestly in the sighted community for my endeavors than the blind one. i tell people is a fact of life, it‚Äôs a new reality you have to face. the blindness community or some in in it can find solutions for you, but otherwise, it‚Äôs kind of unhealthy to suddenly join it and spend all day in it! i‚Äôve seen that, and it‚Äôs really sad. i am blind but honestly outside the internet i spend a lot of my days just as a normal person, living in the normal sighted community. if you act normal, i find you get good reactions, and just as accepted. it‚Äôs okay to get some pointers from independence places how to adapt then go back to the world, the sighted world, and just live like the normal person. the only reason i hang out here occasionally, is to help people with stuff like this. i get a lot of flak for trying to just live my life as a normal person. i am not a blind person or sighted person, i say, i am just a normal person.. i‚Äôve been called a super blink once, by this militant person for the blind, and her championed cause is blindness.  i honestly don‚Äôt see the difference, i don‚Äôt have vision, so what? i don‚Äôt know blindness has to do with anything. i have a odd sleeping schedule sometimes, like today. okay... but i just met some artcy people who claimed they do too. they are sighted, one guy slept from 6 to 2 pm. okay... i eat food, sleep, get up go to school, i might have taken 7 years, but still pretty normal lifestyle, studying to be a political scientist now, work in the political parties. i go out out to eat, sometimes. i take the buses obviously because i don‚Äôt have to drive, but everyone else on them is sighted so not only blind people thake buses. i‚Äôve only met a few other blind people on the buses. i get online and talk to people like everyone else. oh wait. i don‚Äôt see what stands out in my life. like i said, pretty normal here.  i‚Äôll list a few of my accomplishments for you so just that you know that it‚Äôs possible. i don‚Äôt want to brag but i‚Äôll list them because it‚Äôs true, if you want it, you can do anything! you can be the most amazing person in general, or the least being the normal blind person, who some of them honestly i‚Äôve seen a lot in these communities don‚Äôt do much, spends all day ripping in to each others, complains, not very independent, spends all day doing who know what. your choice.  in elementary school i ran for the asb and won the presidency. i was totally blind by then. i used my blindness and some other stuff to win it. since then there has been a movement at that school to beat my record amongst the visually impaired community there. there is a vision center there. i am honored by this, and it‚Äôs interesting. i certainly didn‚Äôt start this culture, but i think my success has stirred the pot to some extent.  in middle school i had a lot of extracurricular opportunities. i went surfing, i got a lot of help because i am not the most fit person in the world. my balance isn‚Äôt the most spot on on a surfboard in the middle of the ocean. i went deep sea fishing in high school, water skiing. i did other trips too, all through this blindness organization. i was their flier girl and appeared on the front of their magazine because i wasn‚Äôt afraid to try and volunteer to attempt anything. when asked i knew i could do it, and was not so locked in my fears and was willing to do it. everyone took two steps back. i took no steps forwards for a moment to be considerate of others but i had no issues stepping forward and saying me, i‚Äôll do it. i don‚Äôt think i am abnormal, honestly, not special. just someone who can and will try. i say any blind person can do what i am doing and is in reason what i am doing. i did a lot of that stuff in middle school and really begun to speak up about just how capable blind people can be, and how normal we could be.  in high school, i did a little of that but i did other stuff too, and this extracurricular stuff began to fade. i read widely, became pretty in depth and informed.  i served on the journalism team for 3 years. i like anyone else, went out, navigated the school independently, got interviews, wrote the pieces and submitted them. i was widely read apparently after my publication. i was the political and opinion columnist for a long time. i never got the editorship or eic position i wanted but it would probably not be my avenue either, and not because i was blind. it was relatively for high school a lot of work, but i got it done. the real stuff i am not as a fan of, but even for sighted people, you have better be a certain calabir and grade. anyway, i won spirit of the paper award basically. i was an enthusiastic and ambitious member of the school newspaper. i was the only blind person the whole time i served. i was recommended to the paper at the end of my freshman year. i was nearly the youngest person on it. not a lot of sophomores got on the paper.  i lead an online group in a writing workshop. that was really fun. everyone besides me was sighted. i ran it for a year to a year and a half. i wrote most of the rules and structures of the group and the administration of it. i had to say it died a year and a half or two years after i left the leadership up to someone else. i was beloved as the leader, no one was going to forget my leadership, and i was an honored member of the community. i had to step down due to personal time management issues.  at this time, i began to travel the city, and gain a lot of mobility independence. by this point, i have traveled 3 counties, and many major metropolitan urban cities. i live in los angeles, know los angeles very well. i also have traveled a bit around orange county, and san francisco. i know most of those counties very well. i know a bit of the inland empire. and could probably figure it out. i have also traveled around hong kong for 3 weeks and had little issues. this traveling is mostly post high school though.  i was at a normal school, in normal classes, and got a and b grades. i went to the school that the movie freedom writers happened at. obvious it‚Äôs gotten a lot better. it‚Äôs a classical high school. afterwards i went to a private jesuit university, also very few blind and disabled people, but now back at a community college due to a lack of funds, but again, normal sighted people. i say, mostly i‚Äôve gotten excellent grades. i was the top grade in the class last semester, and i was the only blind person in it. i have been for years generally known as the outspoken, smart, bright, and intelligent student. i was sort of the teachers favorite in sixth grade because i did so well in that class. i am sure at that age i was the most hardworking student, never missed an assignment.  at this point, i‚Äôve also served on a more professional paper, but due to the stress i had to resign. you have to be super ready and super good at being in a really high stress environment though. i know and yesterday heard how how not special i was, because a lot of normal sighted people had to quit the school paper too. however, when i was on it for 6 weeks i wrote 5 stories, i did interviews for a few more. i worked the larger community college campus myself, interviewed people, made appointments. i interviewed without appointments too. on club day i promoted our paper and successfully passed out all our fliers. after the club day thing there was a few left so i wondered around and past out the few remaining ones, no more then 10. we had a large pile. i got the idea to call out for our paper, stop people when they walked by, and wave our flier around. again, i was the only blind person there. i thought up those strategies enumerated there..  i worked hard to promoted and handed out over 200 papers, i am sure i worked the hardest at this. i don‚Äôt think anyone passed out 200 copies like me. i worked the campus, walked around independently, worked the cafeteria a few times that week and an a half, worked the student union. i was told i was good at it by someone i knew and no one has passed out papers like that!  i am on this blind community, and i organized our first get together, which has become a tradition now, but i don‚Äôt think they are trying as much as i did, and it‚Äôs an easy, whoever wants to come kind of thing. we‚Äôre popular so if you know me and in the area let‚Äôs get together. i did extensive searching and organizing myself.",1,,2
570684,"let's get serious people.   the same happy people complaining about a  pounds or two of cigarette butts or the little over 2 pounds of smoke we create a year are driving supposedly green cars that are dumping about 50 pounds of debris from their standard sized tires and brakes per year. what about green race cars, suvs, pickups and exotics with over sized tires and brakes. ask leno and hannah and gore!  the heck with the exhaust emmissions which only produce about 8lbs a year. a tree produces 40 lbs of hydrocarbons a year. they feed on the fossil fuel in the ground in dry hot months almost as much as the water they absorb when it rains or doesn't. 40 pounds- 325 trees per acre. carbon offset what??  the materials coming off brakes and tires are asbestos, shredding metal powders, carbons, minerals, glass, ect. a semi with 18 wheels throws over 2 tones per year in tire waste alone, not counting the carcasses they toss.   there are 500 million vehicles, 50 million households. thats the same as placing the absbestos, carbon and soot from 10 cars or about 8 full sized tires and 80 brake pads in every household sink in america every year. known carcinogens in your garage next to your kitchen. you kid helping you wash or work on the car. flowing into gutters down to the beach water and sand on your beach where you roll in it and get the skin cancers .   people we had the same sun we had 20 years ago. we had half as many cars but the same percentage of smokers as today. 20 years ago before some fool decided to quit using drum brakes that were at least partially enclosed and starting using disc brakes and added  over sized softer composite tires that throw the carcinogenic crap all over the place into the air you are breathing the house you are dusting, the fast food you are consuming while you drive. we are eating rubber, asbestos and composite materials. it's not the 10,000 or so milligrams of 2nd hand smoke per year a smoker creates.  we build outdoor eating areas next to major streets and intersections. 10-20 cars pass them a day.   by the way you corn gas users. it takes an acre of gas to fill up and drive about 260 miles. thats 50 acres of corn per year per car to travel 13000 miles.   your produce this gas from corn or sugar cane by wetting it and heating it in enclosed vats. they capture the gas in tanks. it's called fermenting.  what do you suppose is happening to the corn while it is being watered and heated by the sun out in the fields for the 3 to 4 months it is growning in the 80-90 degree sun. it's fermenting and the gas is going into the air/atmosphere.   on the other hand we did lower the production of lead, pvc and asbestos products in the us in the 80's. thats when we started seeing outsourcing if you remember. they moved the production (and jobs) of products using and made with those materials to 3rd world countries. but did you know we do not regulate materials used in imported products  coming back in or sold in america. not unless of course some user's group finds out and it becomes a big news story like poisoned pet food, lead painted toys or asbestos in baby and face powders.  your media makes its money on cars and insurance and home products and on anti-smoking ads by the groups that complain about 10,000 mgs per year of 2nd hand smoke while they ignore the 40-50 pounds of carcinogens coming off the tires and brakes of your hybrid every single year or even the 15-20 gallons of raw petroleum it takes to make those tires.   you want to tax someone how about a 10 cent tax per bullet, or how about raising the current $2-3.00 environmental tax on tires by adding and additional 25 cents or so per pound tax on tires that are larger than say the 16 inch diameter and x 7 inch width standard tire. a standard sized tire would not be taxed but those oversized minivan, suv, muscle car, big wheeler idiots and camper van tires sure would be. perhaps an extra $10-$20 dollars extra per wheel change every year or so. strickly to cover health issues related to the cancers caused by these 2 products. multiply that by the 500,000,000 licensed vehicles in america and now you have a reasonable and responsible tax on a seriouly dangerous product.   brake pads and rotors are the serious  killers though and should have a hazardous waste tax that adds a dollar or so per ounce tax. it only takes .012 microns of asbestos in your system to cause cancer. once in your body it is usually there for life. ask rosie the riveteer (building ships, tanks, and planes), our gis, war correspondents and actors making action movies(black powder and blown up building materials containing asbestos, metals and ceramics) our auto workers(tires, brakes, hoses and belts), our road crews that lay and demo asphault, the floks who live in the inner cities next to freeways and highways and continual building in their schools and workplaces, our factory workers.  even our radio djs and media people have been so convinced it's tobacco they never even consider that the invisible asbestos and metal dusts and powders flying off black vinyl records and cassette tapes might be dangerous and causing their cancers. or perhaps that their daily exposure and overuse of imported asbestos laden powdered makeups might actually be toxic not just for their skin but a cause for cancer.   nope they blame it on water soluble plant that is grown and harvested and cooked like any other plant they find in their grocery.  they would never consider that humans take around 20,000 breaths a day and that the measliy 300 or so a smokers takes of tobacco are actually filtering out most of the water soluble vegetable product as well as the other small carcinogenic toxins in the air we can't see but breath.    by the way. a great air filter for smoker, 2nd hand smoke, smells and other household dust like wind blown tire and brake dust. attach a 3m furnace filter to a 20 inch box fan(tape, velcro, etc). cheaper and more productive than an oreck or holmes and your hvac filter will also stay cleaner longer.  so is smoking healthy. heck no!   but it's safer than driving or eating in a car with your windows open, running down a busy street, crossing the mall parking lot or thru a parking structure, swimming at the ocean near a sewer outlet, swimming in a stream, river or lake near any city or highway, or growing up on or near a farm that is going to be used to grow some gas producing product like corn or sugar.   a few acres of corn for food wouldn't be too bad, but the acreage required for producing gas. well it would be like sitting in the middle of a herd of flatulent buffalos or massive oil field on a hot summer day. similar to what we did to our gis between iraq and kuwait during desert storm.   i wonder if anyone ever wondered what it is really like to live and breath the toxins emitted in oil rich desert countries like iraq, iran, sa, etc. especially in the summer months. what would 24 hours of toxic fumes  in your breathing air and water would do to your brain cells and capacity for thought.  i bet it would make for some great religious  thoughts and hallucinations. kind of like  eating a mushroom or peyote button but with one hell of sinus pain.",0,,
926448,"i'm concerned about the divide between those who find their disability to be part of themselves and who have come to terms with it and those of us who struggle with internal issues and consider their disability to be a nuisance. i obviously don't mind the former perspective because it's people's very genuine experience, but i am part of the latter camp. i would take a cure any day, and the medication i take for anxiety and depression is worth it because i am no longer borderline agoraphobic when it comes to coping mechanisms. i've overcome depression to achieve self-sufficiency and get a very good postgraduate degree, and when just being alive is a struggle, i'm proud that i can get out of bed and do things rather than be floored by fatigue or constrained to a single room for days on end due to a foot injury.   i think the biggest problem is being able to voice the latter perspective while making sure the former is protected -- which tends to be the perspective from which a lot of the identity politics emerges and which means people get called out as ableist for talking in terms of cures or recovery. thus the well-meaning woke strand of thought in able-bodied people can get to the point where the second viewpoint is rejected out of hand because it becomes taboo to portray disabled people overcoming what for them is a stressful, painful thing that takes a lot of struggle to overcome in itself before we even begin to talk about social rights and acceptance, rather than an integral part of their identity. i'm not 'neurodiverse'; you don't have to patronise me into accepting a part of myself that is like carrying a large weight around all day that i can never put down. i get enough grief already from people who don't understand the conditions i suffer from to put up with people trying to nanny me and tell me what i feel about my own conditions. i'm neurodisabled, and i need my meds and you can pry them from my cold dead hands.  i wouldn't presume to lecture anyone of the former camp on their preferences, but being in the latter camp makes me feel that ov tended to ignore or denigrate my personal experience of cognitive disabilities which have been almost wholly negative and may be getting worse as i get older. the reason that ov was recently deprecated was that agents were using it to actually 'out' queer and neurodiverse/disabled authors rather than keep their identities reasonably private but still able to talk from experience.   it got to the point, i think, of allies who meant well trying to gatekeep the actual people with stories to tell, or for them to be seen as a monolithic group without varied opinions and perspectives that create a true diversity of work out there. the 'you must be this woke to ride' problem was in danger of smothering people that the movement was supposed to be promoting. this deprecation of the ov hashtag came from the people who set it up. i agree that it was replacing one oppressive ideology perpetrated by the kyriarchy with an equal and opposite reaction which just created new overlords rather than a more egalitarian market. i think ov as a concept is still useful, but like any human social construct it was being followed blindly rather than being applied with care and nuance.  with disability, our difference is not just cosmetic and/or socially constructed; it's a very real, very physical and biological/neurological handicap, and i really welcome anyone who wants to write about that kind of thing because it is a part of many people's experiences. even those who are not permanently disabled or have lifelong conditions can get injured and hurt. you don't know whether someone like my husband or my exboyfriend have had to go through surgery for dislocated bones or have had to use support bandages for chronic tennis elbow, but everyone has been in pain or ill at some point (even my parents who think it's a sign you need to eat more beans). so in that respect it's actually ok by me if a non-disabled author wants to write about being in pain or having an injury. i'm not physically disabled but i have a broken ankle on the mend. i don't have a chronic back problem but i found that i got a psychosomatic illness through grief at my husband's death which has been remarkably persistent two years on. i have to live with it because i can't just relax and let it go, and of course physiotherapy or a visit to a chiropractor or osteopath has been a problem during the pandemic. so i can write about someone experiencing chronic pain from personal experience, but it's not something i'd want to list in a query letter and back pain is notoriously difficult to prove even to a doctor, let alone an agent.  there have been some amazing books where a non-disabled author has got to the root of the matter and done their homework and research into how disability can have a very negative impact on people. i think that's an important part of the disabled experience (as is the increasing awareness of carers and people around the disabled person; when my husband had cancer, i of course was 100% behind him but it took its toll on me. seeing your loved one in a condition more associated with war crime photos is unbearable, and the sharp neurological pain of seeing him laid out in the hospice waiting for the funeral home to come and take him away will be there for the rest of my life), and it's something that inexplicably people try to shout down or hide because it doesn't fit the woke identity politics paradigm, or it depicts people around the actual subject not at their best. (after six weeks of having to live with my mum after my injury  because my house only has an upstairs toilet, we were both ready to kill each other, and for good reasons on both sides.) i despise the characters in house who make the doctor's life a misery; i empathise with his pain, and so they just look callous and full of it -- you'd think that as doctors themselves they'd be able to understand why he was in so much distress and how that made him grumpy -- and i would hope he got hr to give them all diversity training. the ada must not exist in their universe otherwise he'd have been given major adjustments to both his working environment and schedule.  i am, i guess, in the doctor house school of thought about how to portray disability or life-changing/restricting illness. don't patronise us by saying we're ok as we are. give us the vicodin or the zoloft or the kitten gets it. we're more than our conditions, but our conditions colour who we are and how we're able to go about being the people we want to be and quite often they *stop* us being that person.  getting back to your actual topic, there are some really good portrayals of disabled people who are disabled through injury or torture that have to learn to live with their conditions. as i said, most people will be lucky to live their lives out without injury or sickness. even my mum had a headache after she had her vaccination, and she didn't tell me until afterwards that she'd had a few cancerous cells removed from her face. covid has introduced a lot of otherwise healthy people to long periods of convalescence and permanent damage, or the deaths/brain damage of loved ones. i know two people at work who have had it; they come in occasionally and months after their actual illness they still look exhausted. long covid might be a wake up call to those who fetishise healthy lifestyles by giving people even just a glimpse of what it's like to live with chronic conditions. it allows people to understand what life with lower energy levels looks like and why fresh air and healthy eating is important but not the sole way to manage illness.  any medical drama needs to be able to portray pain, injury and disease with some artistic license in there. robert romano famously had his arm ripped off in er, and developed an all too understandable fear of the helipad on the roof. in a softer side to his character he used sign language to talk to doctor benson's son, and that storyline was very even-handed at the way benson went about procuring treatment for rees and being persuaded not to go for a cochlear implant.   joe abercrombie portrayed glokta so well internally that i'm sure he must have experienced spoon theory for himself or known someone with such life-limiting injuries intimately. the sequences in asoiaf of jaime lannister trying to compensate for losing his sword-hand are very true to life. thankfully i haven't *lost* a limb, but i was recently injured quite badly in a fall (so bad even the radiographers remark on it) and the pain has been so excruciating four months on that i am struggling to get to work every other day, let alone five days a week, and everything is seen through a veil of ouch. doctor house has nothing on me at the minute. meanwhile, the soap opera eastenders gave one character epilepsy to demonstrate hidden disabilities but also how disability doesn't stop someone defining themselves by different yardsticks.   so yeah, i would like to see more accurate portrayals of disability that take into account the non-social issues we face, and the acknowledgement that anyone can become disabled, whether through illness or injury or just through the natural process of aging (my dad was a pall-bearer at my grandma's funeral but four years on when my husband died his back was not in a good place and he had to decline when i asked him to do the honours; in any event, the cricket team volunteered). i agree that if some people prefer it to be a non-issue that they're blind, deaf, autistic etc, that's fine. but from fairly recent experience, it seems it's become taboo to talk about disability as something other than an identity, and while i can never actually be cured, i see my meds as a huge leap towards that state rather than simply a coping mechanism. and living in pain right now makes me very thankful that i'm not glokta, house or jaime, because i've had enough pain to last me a lifetime.",1,-1,1
779204,"others have spoken to the decisions being made before birth.  ideally what i would like to see, since the states are insisting on getting involved, that the state works for the percentage they're currently taking off the top of child support checks, instead of simply profiting from the financial misery of non custodial parents. here‚Äôs how i would change the current system: 1.  both parents pay checks according to a court ordered payment schedule.  no more noncustodial parents pay and custodial parents collect.  both parents pay.  the schedule will be predetermined based on the necessary cost to raise the child/ren.  the amounts for custodial and noncustodial parents to be decided based on the percentage of income of each parent.  the two incomes combined totaling 100%.  for example if she makes 100,000 and he makes 30,000 than his functional payment will be 30 percent that of hers, but he must still make the monthly payment of 30% of the court ordered payment to the state, as must she pay 70%.    on a court ordered child care cost of $700.00 a month, she with her higher income would be responsible for $490, and he with his lower check would be responsible for $210, unless he (a non disabled custodial parent) claimed no income, in which case he would become immediately liable for 50%, or $350, and she would be responsible for the remaining 50%, or $350.   at no time will either custodial parent, or non-custodial parent be responsible for less than 30% of the child rearing costs, or $210 in this case.   this eliminates any tendency towards the perception that child care checks are monthly palimony/alimony and can be diverted to the personal uses of the custodial parent.  this helps custodial parents understand that the non-custodial parent is not the only parent responsible for providing financially for the child/ren.  the custodial parent, presumably the provider of day to day care will not at any time warrant more monetary discretion based simply on the notion that they provide the day to day care.  most noncustodial parents would prefer they be the custodial parent providing that care, and would likely not claim normal parenting and supervision as costs. if at any point the custodial parent fails to meet his financial responsibility the state will initiate a custody hearing on the basis that he, as the custodial parent is no longer capable of meeting his financial responsibility of properly caring for his child/ren and it therefore becomes the interest of the child to be placed with the noncustodial parent, who has been meeting her responsibilities to the child/ren. 2.  the custodial parent gets the total of combined child care checks from both parents, minus the state's cut, free and clear, for the first month.    every month there after the custodial parent submits a monthly expenditure report, including receipts, accounting for 90% of all the money they received and spent on behalf of their child/ren.  custodial parents will not be allowed to claim monetary value for the amount of time he spends caring for his child/ren.  the parent denied custody could just as easily provide that child care function for her child/ren, and would do so willingly for free. there are far too many custodial parents that view child care checks as palimony/alimony. what these two steps do is take the financial incentive to be a custodial parent right out of the picture.",0,,

and be yelling it from a distance sometimes. or be like hello sir. and i know this is due to the chair, because when i walk no one ever talks to me. but in the chaor 95% of people awkwardly address me and then are flabbergasted about why the fuck they just said that weird shit to the disabled guy and hurry off. it's exhausting. the adults are 10 times worse than the kids. the kids have an excuse and are curious. the adults are embarrassed to be near me. i always tell kids i got sick and my legs stopped working so now i get robot legs and get to drive around everywhere in electric go carts(disabled shopping scooters lol). the adults also will not look my wife in the eyes if she is pushing me. it's like looking into the sun. people avert their eyes, pull down their baseball hat, cover their eyes with their hands just to not catch a glimpse of the poor woman stuck with a gimp. it's crazy. i sometimes fuck with them to make them more uncomfortable, but the kids i try to instill the idea that disabled people are normal and if anything get cooler stuff than able bodied people in the hopes i don't have to suffer their awkward human ignorance behaviors when they grow up. it may have something to do with the fact i am really young to be disabled, judging by how people treat me. they see me on the electric carts, especially old people, and scowl at me and then realize i have crazy leg braces and a walker or cane in the cart and then they gasp and hurry off. it's comical 80% of the time. also fat people. i know you can't tell someone's disability from just looking sometimes, hell until i lost my leg use the doctors didn't even take me seriously, but they are so entitled. even if you are disabled, at least try to be normal. i was trying to walk into walmart with my wife helping me and i couldn't make it. i slumped down in the foyer and my wife went in to grab a scooter. the autistic guy saw this and went and got a scooter to bring me. then all light was eclipsed when a 450lb woman walked by me. she walked in the doors, stepped in front of my wife and the greeter said are you getting this cart for the man on the ground? she said yep, killed the scooters will to live and puttered off. they were low on scooters so i had to sit there till the poor greeter could find another one. i couldn't believe that shit. but it happens all the time. they've mowed by me while i'm in the walker to get to the scooter first. and i figure you would think if you could walk briskly like that you could just use a shopping cart to get around. but who knows, maybe i'm being an asshole. people parking in handicapped spots or in front of the ramp piss me off. there's been a few times i've pulled up behind them and called the cops so they get the $450 ticket. i always go up and check if they have a placard and just forgot to put it up. they all say the same thing, oh i or so and so is just running in for a second, but if a handicapped person pulled up i was gonna give them the space. which is such bs. i'm always like how would you know? i have to come park behind you, get my chair out, get into my chair, come up here and ask your permission to have the spot, then go back to my car, get back in, load my chair, pull back, wait for you to move your dumbass, pull in and park, get my chair out again, get into my chair again, and then can finally go into panda express. fuck you man. that is not reasonable. you're paying for that shit and maybe you won't do it next time. ug. all in all i'm a happy guy. i just have a lot of pet peeves with inconsiderate people. if your kid is curious, just politely ask if they can ask questions. most disabled people are all for education and reducing the ignorance we have to deal with everyday. plus we were all kids once. if they say no thank you, just be polite and answer the kids questions in the car. don't fucking shush your kids and punish them for being curious. my older brother saw a black guy for the first time when he was 3 and asked why that man was covered in chocolate. he almost fell over laughing and explained races to my brother while my ahole mom was trying to punish him for his curiosity. hope this helps, there's no book of how to deal with the disabled because we are just normal people like you.",1,-1,1
819318,"the idea of a ""school for disabled witches and wizards"" raises a lot of questions. in the real world, or muggle world, you do have schools for the blind, communities of the deaf, and special-needs classrooms - all examples of times when students with disabilities are separated from other students. but that separation in and of itself (separation between ""normal"" students and ""disabled"" students all lumped together) is kind of problematic, because many people who are blind or have a physical disability or something like dyslexia would actually be better off integrated into mainstream society, where they could progress at a faster pace, and get more preparation for the real world, than in a special needs class that might have to go very slowly to accommodate those with mental disabilities.  so in light of what i said above, i would actually prefer reading a story set at hogwarts that features some disabled protagonists (with some supplementary assistants, guide animals, and extra classes) than i would a story set in a completely segregated school.  other brainstorming ideas:  * we are assuming that magic cannot cure these disabilities, otherwise they would not be disabled. and we already know magic can completely heal broken bones. if magic can cure anything else, that eliminates disabilities in that area.  * a paraplegic or quadriplegic wizard might be interested in out-of-body experiences, where the consciousness can be cast out during sleep to spy on people and things  * people with disabilities might be able to do certain things that would be more difficult for students without disabilities. one thing i have heard blind people say is that when your sense of vision decreases, your other senses increase over time. so a blind person usually has enhanced senses of smell and hearing (possibly even using echolocation) and enhanced sensitivity in the fingertips if they use braille. you could run with that idea by creating a magic specialization that is easier for people with enhanced hearing or touch. some kind of magic that is cast through music, perhaps. or you could say that in an ancient runes class, blind people are at an advantage to become expert in the field because they are not distracted by what the runes look like, and can be more in tune with the magical properties of each one.  edit for typos",1,,1

""huh.""  so i lay there for years. this is what in your story caught my attention. sometimes crying, usually just zoned out, for about 7 years - most of high school and college. all day, all night. i wouldn't even go on the internet, just kinda... lie there, for most of a decade. my body didn't seem to be mine, every action felt like i was watching someone else do it. i could barely think, and when i did, it was violent, intrusive thoughts. i did go to work, because we actually needed money (mom could only work part-time because of disability, the retard didn't work at all, and my older siblings had moved out), so i did that. my senior year my mom and i pulled in $14k for the year together for 3 people, and that was a good year.  so don't fucking tell me i don't know what i'm talking about.   i finished college (after 5 years) and law school (estate planning, wills, etc.) and live in nyc because that is where i found a job. young people on the street accuse me of being a shelter, privileged white woman when i ignore their ""causes"" and i just want to bash their skulls in. things are ok now, but only because i changed my attitude and didn't try to kill myself a third time when i finally knew how.   my mother is still a mess - she was recently diagnosed with type ii diabetes (she's also *morbidly* obese) and refuses to take her meds. she's lost weight and is try to get it under control, but she's on the verge of tears every time i see her - she lives in a constant state of panic. that is just her life. she lives in a windowless studio apartment in the ghetto in florida. the retard lives in some shack on church property (i finally told him he had to go), but he's lost a few fingers to the beetus and is nearly blind to boot. last i heard my dad lost his legs to alcoholism (how does that even happen) and was homeless. that was about 5 years ago, he may be dead.   all very, very sad lives all due to people making decisions based on their negative emotions (well, except maybe the poor retard), negative emotions like insecurity and fear (mom), hate (dad) and pride (brother).   you have to start making decisions based on reason rather than feelings. a lady will not solve shit.  have you considered changing jobs? i know in florida, they need people to fly planes into hurricanes to study them.     **tl;dr:** my pathetic life story. wow, i've never seen it all written out like that. i spent some time debating whether to post it, but it's already written out there, so can choose not to read it if you want. maybe it will help, maybe it will just make you madder. i've done what i can from here.  bettering yourself really does have to come from a fundamental shift in how you view the world and yourself, *not a chance in circumstances* unless you've living in subsaharan africa.

633165,"i'd dispute this as someone with a disability. while some people who have been blind or had other disabilities since birth might feel this way, others of us do not. having been autistic and dyspraxic and taking medication to suppress acute gad (which cost me about a decade of career), i can truthfully say that if there was a cure, i'd take it any day; those conditions have made life twenty times harder for me than my friends and i would love it even if all three have been with me all my life. likewise my friend with crippling fibromyalgia or definitely my husband who died of cancer (considered a disability). the keen knitter i bought yarn off on ebay who was selling up because she'd lost her arm in an accident and could no longer practice her craft. i have back pain due to grief and *bloody hell would i like it to go away*.  it's nice to be woke, and i agree about respecting those who do feel that their identity is connected to being deaf or blind (and i mean that in a respectful way) but if we erode what we're 'allowed' to write, sometimes we throw the baby out with the bathwater. i get the feeling that writing about white men is ok because the story can be about that particular white man. but write something about a woman, or a disabled person or whatever and suddenly you're speaking about all women, all disabled, all whatever. in reality, we're all different and will respond differently to different things.   so while respect and sensitivity and diversity are really important, i think truly showing diverse people in fiction includes those who may not have the 'woke' perception of their situation but have a different experience altogether. a character in a book can represent all women, but quite often they just represent that particular woman. i found love and happiness and confidence in the arms of a man who i loved and who loved me back; he made me who i am now and rescued me from the depths of mental health issues. he could have been a woman and i a man for all his gender played a part in that, but i can't help being a het woman who fell in love with her best friend and had that love returned a hundredfold. but i've seen people here attack memoirs written by women who found love and acceptance along that trajectory as somehow reinforcing that women can *only* find love in a man's arms. in reality, a book should speak not for all women, all disabled, all whoever, but for individuals with lived experience. and so we come to the meat of my post.  while some disabled people do feel this way, there is no one-size-fits-all. wanting a cure for something that affects your ability to function in the world is as much part of the life of someone with a disability as is adapting to it and getting support from the wider community. it's really not ableist to suggest someone even who doesn't know any different to want to be able to function in a different way. (when i got on meds for my gad, it was like seeing the world clearly and being able to think straight for the first time in literally 38 years. it took my husband getting sick and realising i needed help to best help him to get those meds sorted, but i wouldn't be without them ever again.)  with identities such as being a woman or being a poc, it's true that the story should definitely focus on other issues. but for disability, the issue quite often is an internal struggle, perhaps to come to terms with the limitations a condition puts on leading a life. identity in terms of race or gender is socially at issue, and can be solved by social understanding and progress. but someone with gad will be at the mercy of their own mind whether or not society makes allowances for it. i can take all the personal days and sick leave i want, but it's no fun being too scared to turn on google because you're afraid of seeing anything to do with politics or having to get over a fear of bank balances because at one point twenty years ago you ran out of money.  i realise someone without sight who has been blind since birth might feel differently, but *please* don't think all disabled people are offended by the idea of cures for even congenital conditions, or want stories to be about something other than overcoming a disability. perhaps a book about the internal struggle of someone to cope with a rebellious body is actually a good thing -- it shows people what we actually go through even if society at large is understanding and helpful. the 'invisible disability' thing has taken off here and has been a real success. but that people didn't bat an eyelid when my husband sat in starbucks the week before his death with bare, swollen feet didn't stop him, well, being dead only a week later. it didn't stop his two-year struggle with knowing his body was eating him alive and needing to make his peace with it; in fact i think that making peace with it in that last week actually meant he could pass on with dignity in a hospice bed rather than just expire on the couch like someone else i know did.  as regards fictional examples of what i mean, jaime lannister is a really good example of someone's internal struggle against the loss of an important limb and who has a believable response even though he knows there's no cure. glokta in *first law* also has the same approach to his disability, and i related to him a lot because the author played the spoon theory thing really well; additionally, you never really saw him before he was permanently crippled by torture, so unlike jaime he's assimilated his difficulties *but crucially, they're still there and it feels like he'd jump at the chance to cure them*. it's not all about social acceptance or non-discrimination.   fiction is there to depict life as it's lived rather than just life as we'd like it to be. it's quite often about daily struggles that are never going to get any better ever that stop you doing things you need or want to do or simply sometimes stop you getting up in the morning. from a carer's perspective, you can have all the wheelchair ramps and step-free access you want, and when we were on a cruise with it the staff bent over backwards to help us, but it doesn't mean the wheelchair isn't heavy to push, cumbersome to store and a pig to manoeuvre. it's something that my husband didn't need all the time, just when he got fatigued, was coming in and out of hospital  or travelling long distances, and he jolly well hated using it and felt confined and restricted by it. it wasn't a liberating device; to him, it was like being chained up and a reminder of what he'd lost.  if we can't acknowledge that, because it's somehow ableist to portray someone being frustrated and restricted by a disability and seeking to put that frustration right, then we do actually erase quite genuine feelings and emotions that are part of living with a disability that is different to me, as a woman, living with my gender identity. if we can't talk about that part of disability, then people who are injured or blinded or deafened or impaired by accidents or disease or mental triggers will actually find it harder, not easier, to get support. after losing my husband, reading about other people's experiences with grief -- even enkidu's death in the *epic of gilgamesh* -- helped me come to terms with the feeling and not feel quite so alone. the thought that people have been writing about the death of a loved one or bff since the dawn of recorded history and then some comforts and supports me. for someone going through a sudden loss of body function or coming to terms with something they haven't got but other people have, showing that disability is a real thing that affects how life is lived and acknowledging that a lot of disabled people would really prefer not to be disabled at least shows us we're not alone, particularly when we go from sighted to unsighted, healthy 40 year old to 44 year old wasting away in a hospice bed, or in the opposite direction -- person too afraid to go into a newsagent to someone who can do that because of one single pill taken when she gets up.  glossing over how to live with a disability suddenly thrust upon you, or that feels like it's holding you back even if it's been there all your life, is erasing that part of daily life for a lot of people, particularly because a lot of disabilities are something that can happen to otherwise able-bodied people. the girl who lost her leg in the accident at alton towers several years ago may eventually come to terms with it, but it doesn't mean everything is hunky-dory and the disability becomes just cosmetic. if she got the ability to regrow her leg, would it be ableist to say she should take that chance?  so really, truly, i think there is definitely a place for disability in fiction to be more than just cosmetic, just like in some books racial or gender identities matter more to the plot than in other works.  sorry to rant and get angry, but this sort of thing just erases genuine struggles even for people like me who were born with our conditions. there must be a place to acknowledge people who struggle with disabilities and wish they would diaf as well as people who consider it part of their identity. i know you mean well, but there are many different takes on this and many different ways in which we think. it's not just social issues or identity at play; i do not like the idea that my disabilities are part of an identity, any more than my husband identified as a cancer patient (or even a survivor when he was in remission for two years). it's a very real, very internal struggle which would be there regardless of what goes on outside. i think there is definitely a place for fantastical cures for people struggling with disability. i'd agree that it should be a choice or something that she's not forced into, but to say that no disabled person ever wants to be cured is simplistic at best and erases genuine internal struggles at worst.",1,,0

252666,"&gt;wow, i wish i understood any of that. i'd probably even follow through on your excellent advice. i sometimes feel as the only not comp sci person in reddit.  i clearly need to do a better job of explaining myself, then.  :-)  basically, here's what i'm saying:  data sent over the internet is broken up into packets.  simply, though not perfectly accurately, it could be said that packets sent from your computer over a broadband connection normally contain 1 to about 1450 bytes each.  it's possible, if data is coming into a device that moves packets from a fast line to a slower line, for packets to pile up at that point.  the sort of device that we'd be using here is normally called a ""bridge"".  the bridge will normally store a certain number of packets, and then discard any beyond that.  the computers that are sending data over the connection are responsible for realizing that the packets have been dropped (generally, because they don't get a response from the other side) and for sending them over again, and are generally fairly clever at learning a reasonable rate to send data so that their packets are rarely dropped -- however, if enough programs are trying to send data (particularly if they aren't being very polite in doing so -- bittorrent and most modern filesharing software are good examples), the line eventually becomes rather unusably choked.  for home broadband connections, normally a user can receive packets at a greater rate than he may send packets.  typically, he can download data perhaps five or six times as quickly as he can upload data.  if he is using a program like bittorrent (probably the largest single source of data sent on the internet today), he frequently tries to send data about as quickly as he can receive it.  this means that packets go very quickly from his computer, over his network, and to the dsl or cable modem (the device that connects the relatively slow dsl/cable connection to the fast house network), where they become choked.  to make matters worse, dsl/cable modems normally can store quite a few packets.  once that queue is full, any new packet that manages to get in line must wait for the entire line to empty before it can be sent over the dsl/cable line.  i've seen this require from around a second to around ten seconds.  a second is already quite painful for some interactive programs, usable (though noticeably slower to respond) for web browsing, and unusably long for playing most computer games over a network.  as a result, once someone has flooded their outbound line, many of their programs become unusable.  if the cable/dsl modem was a bit smarter, it could treat some packets specially.  for example, if a file is being downloaded, normally a user doesn't care if a file takes a bit longer to finish.  however, they care a great deal if they are playing a video game and their actions don't take effect for a second after they push a button.  the modem could theoretically let any packets associated with the video game jump to the front of the line.  it's not entirely fair, but it means that the video game plays just about as if there were no traffic going on, and the file transfer is perhaps just a titch slower, but not something that the user really cares about (it just means that he'll play his video game for a bit longer while waiting for the file transfer to finish).  this sort of clever letting-of-some-packets-go-before-others and a few related techniques is referred to as ""quality of service"", or qos.  unfortunately, all the cable and dsl modems that i've seen don't have software on them capable of doing this.  the modem is the only device that can do this -- the user's computer can't -- since the user's computer has no idea how long the backed-up line of packets is and has no way of telling the modem to let a packet jump in front of the others in line.  there is another approach that can be taken, though.  the modem is normally the device where the line of packets gets backed up, because it is the slow point in the outbound line.  it is possible to get another device (this is the bridge i was referring to above) that sends packets at an even *slower* rate than the modem.  this device is plugged in between the modem and the computer, and then the line of packets builds up in the new bridge.  the bridge can have the smarts to do qos on the packets.  that means that it can do all sorts of nice things:  * if there are multiple computers attached to one modem, let a roughly equal amount of packets from each skip ahead to the front of the line.  this means that even if some users are using impolite applications like bittorrent, all the users on the network can continue to send packets and maintain a reasonable outbound rate of packets making it out, as opposed to the typical situation today, where one user with bittorrent effectively kills the network for everyone else.  * packets from certain applications can be tagged as being ""high priority"" and jump ahead to the front of the line.  this is good for phones that send audio data over the internet, video games, some types of interactive applications, and so forth.  * sometimes, the line in the modem (as i said, 1 to 10 seconds worth of outbound data) is simply too long.  if the bottleneck is in the bridge, and thus the line forms in the bridge, it can set the line to be as long or as short as it wants (though it probably wants at least some line, so that there's a packet waiting to go out to the internet the moment the line frees up).  as for technical details -- there was a great way to designate packets as important or not important.  each packet on the internet has several bits reserved for doing just this -- called ""type of service"" bits and later dscp bits.  unfortunately, microsoft effectively broke the ability of applications to request that the operating system tag packets as high priority or low priority in changes they made when releasing windows xp, though this functionality remains in place on other operating systems.  (technically, it's still in xp, but disabled.)  there are a few other ways to figure out what packets should be high-priority.  for most packets on the internet, there is a number (referred to as a ""port"" number), which indicates to which application on the destination computer a packet should be given.  for a web server, this number is most commonly set to 80 -- when you go to reddit.com in your web browser, packets are being sent with a destination port of ""80"".  world of warcraft (at least on all the servers that blizzard entertainment operates today, and since blizzard fights hard against anyone who [sets up compatible servers](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/bnetd), this will probably stay this way) uses a port of 3724. this can be used as a crude way to determine which packets belong to which applications and thus which should be high priority.  unfortunately for us, there are no absolute requirements that a particular program use one port.  some programs, like bittorrent, typically use a random set of ports.  others, like some instant-messaging programs, use a port chosen from a wide range of numbers.  most server software allows a user to override the preset port number.  point is, there isn't a terribly reliable way to determine what packets should be high-priority based on port number.  as i said in the original post, this approach can't help deal with issues of purely downstream (data coming from the internet to a user's computer) rate -- the internet service provider, be it verizon or comcast or someone else, will normally produce the first bottleneck on their end of the cable/dsl line, on hardware that a user has no control over.  usually, though, upstream (data going from a user's computer to the internet) is the problem.  this is, unfortunately, not a cheap, good, out-of-the-box solution that i'm aware of and would call completely satisfactory -- openwrt is just a small linux distro, so one would have to be reasonably comfortable with linux networking to set this up.  i'd love for linksys and other vendors of cheap consumer broadband routers to stick support for tos bits and some other decent form of qos on their products.  linksys does sell a bridge that probably does [something along these lines](http://www.linksys.com/servlet/satellite?c=l_product_c2&amp;childpagename=us%2flayout&amp;pagename=linksys%2fcommon%2fvisitorwrapper&amp;cid=1146774321820), but i haven't used it -- it may just do the same relatively basic qos that their wireless-access-point devices do, which lets one prioritize traffic on a particular port or coming in from a particular computer.  theoretically, one could allow anonymous users on one's network via wireless, but always make any of one's own data jump in front of them.  in this case, they effectively only soak up excess bandwidth, which is what i was referring to in the original post.  i personally have custom-rigged something like this on a linux box, and it's *marvelous*.  one can use something like bittorrent and web-browsing or similar feels as if there is absolutely nothing else on the line -- or i can have three computers trying to send masses of data, and a fourth can continue to web browse without problems.  finally, this isn't, strictly speaking, a matter of computer science.  computer science (which usually, though not always, isn't science, either) generally deals with the theory and mathematical side of computing.",0,,

519436,"my girlfriend is a interpreter for hearing impaired, and she had this same viewpoint.  i myself am losing my hearing, and may go deaf after too long.  after many long discussions, my arguments boil down to these (mostly) inarguable points:  point 1)  *""disabled"" or ""broken"" is when a thing cannot do what it was intended to do.*  a ladder with missing rungs.  shoes without soles.  human beings are built to walk, see, and hear.  therefore, someone who is blind, deaf, or lame is disabled.  not a qualitative judgment, just a fact.  the level of disability seems to be most people's argument.  ""deaf culture"" is mostly promoted due to the fact that hearing-parents will cripple their children by not teaching them about how to cope with being hearing impaired.  hearing-parents would opt for cochlear implants and then treat the child as a hearing-child, and as such, among other issues, the language center of the child's brain wouldn't be as developed as it could be had they also allowed the teaching of sign language.  many in the deaf culture will argue against the use of cochlear implants, saying that there's nothing wrong with being deaf and they shouldn't try to ""fix"" it.  deaf culture exists and they strive to protect their culture by encouraging parents to leave deaf children deaf.  point 2)  *a culture fighting for it's existence is not inherently a good or right thing*, or, *a thing's existence is, alone, not a good reason for it to exist.*  if we remember history, we once had leper colonies where afflicted people would be quarantined.  while some lived in wretched squalor until they perished, many colonies formed a culture of their own, a way to live life, governing themselves, caring for each other, and some even invented their own currencies for daily use (as sharing money was believed to spread leprosy.)  there was a leper culture.  however, not many will argue that we should still have leper colonies today, that we should leave those afflicted uncured, and let them argue for the continued existence.  no one would dare tell a parent who's child become afflicted with leprosy that they should be prevented from curing them, and that instead they should let their child join the leper culture.  (now, people will completely miss the point [though it was explicitly stated] and say ""how dare you compare leprosy to being deaf; they're not the same thing!"" and to them i can only reply ""you're correct, they're not the same thing,"" and leave them stumbling in confusion as to what point they could have missed; have no pity for these people.)  my final stance on the issue:  would that deaf culture cease to exist by the same reasons of leper culture, i would be happy.  if every deaf person could hear, if every blind person could see, and ever lame person be able to walk, i would be happy, even if that means the complete eradication of a culture from the face of the earth, relegating it to a page in history.  so far, only the most callous and vehement (past the point of being rational) deaf advocates (though, to date, no one who is actually hearing impaired) have decided they disagree with my conclusion.",1,,1
420918,"what does ""on disability"" (or ""disabled"") mean?  first, it's apparently not a pc term anyhow--should be ""differently abled"" i' believe. and as silly as that term sounds (to me) it does raise the question:  is anyone really totally disabled?  well, ok, i get that if i'm a quadriplegic or in a coma i'm pretty much totally disabled and need help from  my family, a charity or a government.  but if i lose a leg in a car accident (in which case i sue, of course), does that mean i'm disabled? maybe i can't be a post-office delivery guy, but why not a computer programmer? (actually, i can probably get a prosthetic and still be a post-office delivery guy.)  meanwhile, does not being able to run fast or jump high mean i'm disabled?  maybe for being a football or basketball player.  or what if i'm really short and ugly and can't get a job as a fashion model?  so, everybody's ""disabled"" to some extent and almost no-one is completely incapable of doing some useful and remunerative work.  libertarians do tend to think of a world where everyone is reasonably intelligent, healthy and otherwise ""normal"", so they feel people should be able to make their own way. failing that, they tend to prefer family support or private charity for obvious cases of severe mental or physical disability; and failing that most of them might allow for some sort of government ""safety net"", but somehow limited to really, really severe cases, and not people being irresponsible (not taking care of themselves or not buying health or other basic insurance if they ever had a non-disabled life.)  but the idea that if i lose a leg and can't work at the job i used to do (and can't sue some party at fault for my loss . . .) then i should be ""on disability"" would not fly with most libertarians.",1,,-1

[here's what i wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7igry/welcome_mike_aka_raldi_to_team_reddit/c06qx9t):  ----  traveling is only as expensive as you make it.   hilary and i saved up for most of our late 20s, living in a 400-square-foot apartment and, significantly, having a tiny city hall wedding instead of a giant extravaganza. this allowed us to splurge here and there (renting cars, staying in hotels with air conditioning, visiting first-world countries)  however, even if you only have, say, $5000 -- which you will if you skip the big wedding -- you can still do some really fantastic and life-changing travel. for example, flights from new york to bangkok are currently around $1300 round-trip. alternately, you can get to kunming, china for $1100.. or india for $900. once you get there, the other $3700+ will last months. and, of course, once you get to the other side of the world, you can take short, cheap, local flights; chiang mai to luang prabang is just $129, and the cultures are like night and day. train rides within a country cost even less.  if you go with a buddy, or better yet, a significant other, costs will drop by almost half, since you'll be sharing rental cars, rooms, books, hired guides, etc. really everything except food and admission.  the real extravagant cost of a trip like this is time: you simply can't do it without quitting your job.  i think that, as people start getting married and having babies later and later in life, it's going to be fairly normal to leave one's job and travel for a few months as part of that transition. especially if you're already moving to another city anyway.  and don't worry, you can always get another job. even in this economy.  and you know what? even if i hadn't been able to, even if it had taken me a year to find work, i wouldn't have regretted a thing. not for a second.",0,,

573296,"you make some very well-thought-out arguments (and thanks for taking the time to vocalise them!).  however, to keep this manageable (if you don't mind) i'll try to briefly respond to the most salient points - if you think i've skipped over something important, please point it out. ;-)  **""offence"" and ""reactivating previous trauma""**: this is a strong argument in favour of draconian repression of ""speech that will make people uncomfortable"", but i would submit that ""offence"" and ""an emotional breakdown caused by previous trauma"" aren't really the same thing at all.  offence is a feeling of annoyance or anger caused by a contrary opinion.  what you're talking about here is *trauma*, which is a feeling of insecurity and/or terror caused by association with a previous traumatic event.  i'd argue that while you raise an important point regarding trauma, it really has nothing to do with the issue of ""offence"" (which i was discussing).  **offence**: the trouble with pure ""offence"" is that people can take it at *anything*.  are you familiar with the concept of the [euphemism treadmill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euphemism#euphemism_treadmill)?  the basic premise is that people choose gentler and more euphemistic terms to describe sensitive topics or individuals, but over time those terms *become* pejorative with use.  you start off calling educationally-subnormal people ""morons"" or ""imbeciles"".  then the word acquires pejorative connotations, so you move to ""retard"".  then the word ""retard"" becomes an insult, so you move to ""educationally subnormal"".  then that's deemed too pejorative, so you start referring to ""special needs"" or ""special"".  nowadays even calling someone ""special"" is becoming pejorative, so we're casting about for a new euphemism.  if this process highlights one thing, it's that *offence is a constant* - given time, any word or linguistic construct becomes offensive.  there's nothing inherently offensive about any word - rather, it's the intent behind it that offends.  ban one offensive word and people will merely start using another, until it *becomes* offensive.  you're trying to shield people from offensive *opinions* by banning certain *words*, but the very act of banning a word *makes* other terms become offensive.  it's literally a no-win struggle.  moreover, it makes a language that's expressive and useful progressively dumber and blunter.  ""crippled/retarded"" aren't nice words *now*, but when first used they were descriptive and precise.  then ""disabled"" was considered less pejorative, but it's also less precise and more vague.  ""special needs"" is vague to the point of uselessness - it says nothing about the issue or their needs, other than that they're different to the absolute default.  ""differently abled"" is even worse - it not only implies people have *additional* abilities instead of merely lacking some common ones (generally technically inaccurate, though politically correct to imply), but it smacks of such condescending patronisation that if i was disabled i would be positively offended at someone who felt the need to talk down to me like that.  moreover, *offence is important to protect*.  accusations of corruption, or criminality, or partiality/bias commonly cause offence, but i wouldn't want to live in a society where it was taboo to call someone out for them.  when you hand people a tool to clamp down or restrict the freedom of speech and sharing of ideas (even for what seem like good ideas at the time), you hand a tool to scumbags and criminals and con-men to do the same.  just look at how the libel laws and superinjunctions here in the uk have been abused to threaten and ruin people calling out hucksters, con-men, snake-oil salesmen, corporate criminals and powerful criminals.  the right and ability to give offence is upon occasion too important to the transparency and effective running of society to be banned outright, even if you do so with the best of intentions.  **trauma**: i want to put forward my argument by analogy here - not to mock your position (i respect it), but to provide (i hope) some insight into my viewpoint on the matter:  people who have undergone a trauma may have their trauma re-activated by thoughtless words or actions on the part of others.  true.  however, take people who were disabled in an accident, or specific event.  you could argue that people walking around them is inconsiderate, because it reminds them of what they've lost.  surely by the same logic it would be kinder for everyone to use wheelchairs, or at least avoid standing or walking around in their presence unless absolutely essential?  it wouldn't *prevent* anyone from doing what they needed to do, and it would ease the emotional pain and sense of loss of the recently-disabled.  this is laughable, i agree - it's unreasonable to expect everyone to go out of their way to sit down or crawl around all the time just in case a disabled person sensitive to their position might be around.  even if it doesn't prevent anything being done or achieved, it's unreasonable to expect everyone on earth to go out of their way to accommodate a few individuals.  moreover, there will always be a few individuals who *refuse* to do so, so if the mere sight of someone standing upright can upset a disabled person that much, you're never going to successfully *stop* them getting upset, because there will always be people who don't conform, and who persist in standing up in their presence.  harsh though it may seem, fundamentally their disability is *their problem*.,  it's great if people help out, and try to make them feel better about it, and we should rightly laud those people for their consideration.  however, *mandating* such inconvenience *for everyone all the time* is just an unreasonable imposition.  moreover, it'll never achieve what you want to achieve, and may discourage the sensitive person from trying to recover their own emotional robustness to the point they can deal with the dissenters *without* getting upset or re-experiencing their trauma.  this sounds heartless, but there are precedents.  if someone breaks their leg we don't give them a wheelchair for life - we give them one while they *need* it, and put them through (sometimes painful, sometimes hard, but *always* worthwhile) physiotherapy, *so their leg gets better*.  a society which condemned everyone who ever broke their leg to a wheelchair for life would be a sick, mollycoddling society that encouraged people to become helpless victims.  i gently suggest the same is true of emotional wounds.  **homogenisation, and weeding out of the different**: this is again a good argument, and it's an inherent problem with many societies and groups.  however, social disapproval (for example, downvotes on reddit) already give us a mechanism to express popular discontent and distance the community from unpopular viewpoints.  if someone comes to a forum and sees a hurtful remark, if that remark is downvoted through the floor it shows the community does not agree with it.  if they *still* can't function even in the mere *presence* of such remarks then i suggest they need to avoid *society* until they're able to. do so  like it or not, some people are assholes, and if you're so sensitive that you can't function knowing that, you can't function in society.  this speaks to my earlier point about developing emotional calluses - i don't imply it's easy, and i don't imply the person is wrong for being hurt in the first place.  nevertheless, *life sucks*.  if you become sensitised to the point you can't deal with contrary opinions *even when the overwhelming majority of people in the community publicly disavow them*, you simply can't function in the real world.  i have no problem with support groups and similar institutions having overly-draconian rules - these are the very places where such sensitive people *can* be, until they're robust enough to deal with the rest of society.  that's largely the point of them.  however, support groups exist for a single very specific purpose (to help people deal with issues, and get better), and society exists for a huge number of very different ones.  support groups are not society, and it's wrong to try to *turn* society into one.  a society run like a support group would quickly fall to indolence, corruption and stagnation.  by analogy: a park is not a hospital, so while hospitals need to be sterile and clean, any attempt to sterilise the great outdoors would be an ecological catastrophe.  i'm all for diversity, and heterogeneity, and loud and vociferous debate and exchange of ideas.  however, you don't get that by *banning* all opinions that are too different, or by trying to get people to line up and play nice like they're in kindergarten.  when you restrict the language people can use you restrict the kinds of ideas which may be expressed.  when you object or ban people for even unintentional, minor infractions, or for the *form* rather than *content* of their post, you exert a chilling effect on people's self-expression, and hence on the exchange of ideas.  i'm not arguing people should be lauded for calling each other ""fags"" in a debate, but i am arguing that the community itself should be able to express its disapproval, democratically, rather than a mod unilaterally censoring the speaker's whole point.  likewise, i'm not arguing against hospitals or support groups or kindergartens - all are important, and all have their place.  however, there are plenty of things you can't do in each, and any attempt to turn the whole world into any one of them would be disastrous.  ban sharp scissors or knives or harsh words or offence in one of them if you like, but elsewhere in the world all those things are *necessary and desirable* if you want to have any society run effectively, and particularly if you want to fight corruption, injustice and - yes - privilege.",0,,
579394,"the average students are not, actually, ""less comparable"" in terms of ability or need than disabled students. that is a common misconception -- people often don't realize that *within-group variability* is often much greater than *between-group variability*.   to be more concrete: if a student has a disability, such as being intellectually impaired, they are actually *more* like non-disabled children than they are like other disabled children. example: the collection of disabled students at a particular school might consist of, that intellectually impaired child, as well as a child who is deaf, one who is quadraplegic, one who is partially blind, two who are of average intelligence but dyslexic, one who has a severe thought disorder, one who is also intellectually impaired but differs from this student by more than 30 iq points, three who have autism but of various levels of impairment, and one who is epileptic. each of those learners is actually ""more like"" average learners than they are like any of the other disabled learners.

972946,"&gt; **edit: from http://www.circinfo.net/**  this is a pro-circumcision website.  in return, i will offer you the wealth of knowledge at this website [cirp](http://www.cirp.org/), particularly their [library](http://www.cirp.org/library/).  &gt; **decrease in physical problems involving a tight foreskin [408].**  tight foreskins are a rare malady that take two forms: phimosis and paraphimosis. interestingly, both of these problems are likely caused by [initially poor medical advice](http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/info/info-forcedretraction.html) from ignorant medical practitioners (or meddling parents).  &gt; **lower incidence of inflammation of the head of the penis [162, 168, 172].**  there is actually no clear link between the status of the foreskin and [balanitis](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/balanitis/). for instance, [a study from 1997](http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/vanhowe/) showed that circumcised boys suffer from a higher risk of balanitis.  more importantly, forced retraction can result in balanitis---and forced retraction is very easy to avoid; just don't do it.  &gt; **reduced urinary tract infections.**  [increased urinary tract infections (utis)](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/uti), like most pro-circumcision talking points, mainly came as the result of dubious studies. it turns out, infants are at a higher risk for uti in the weeks following circumcision. besides the fact that utis are generally easy to cure and infrequent, the incidence of infection are roughly the same between an intact boy and a circumcised boy. *moreover, the intact adult is less likely to suffer from a uti than a circumcised adult male, likely because the meatus of the circumcised penis is constantly and directly exposed to the environment.*  more to the point, some doctors recommend circumcision in cases of recurrent uti. however, there is no medical evidence to support this recommendation. recurrent utis are associated with congenital abnormalities of the upper urinary tract. indeed, the national kidney and urologic diseases clearinghouse (nkudic), a service of the national institutes of health does not suggest circumcision as a prevention or cure of urinary tract infection.  it is also interesting to consider girls. a recent scandinavian study found that girls and boys have about the same incidence of uti in the first year of life. girls have a four times higher incidence of uti in the first six years of life than non-circumcised boys. no special concern is manifested regarding this much higher rate of infection in girls...  why don't we alter the genitalia of girls?  therefore, circumcision is not a suitable reason to provide for reducing the risk of utis.  &gt; **fewer problems with erections, especially at puberty.**  this is so vague, all i can do is respond in kind: this is nonsense, and you know it.  &gt; **decrease in certain sexually transmitted infections (stis) such as hiv, hpv, chlamydia, syphilis in men and their partner(s).**  very recently, hiv/aids has replaced utis as the scare-tactic for promoting amputation of the foreskin. however, safe sexual practices are not only essential, but they are the only reliable and effective means for controlling and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases; even though the un's recent (u.s.-led) studies suggest that circumcision reduces the incidence of hiv infection, the un still acknowledges that only sex education and sexually responsible behavior (such as using condoms) are effective solutions.  in fact, [this meta-study of those un studies](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120747249/abstract?cretry=1&amp;sretry=0)  suggests that 72 circumcisions are necessary in order to prevent one case of hiv infection. in conclusion, the researches make a half-hearted endorsement of the procedure:  &gt; male circumcision is an effective strategy for reducing new male hiv infections. its impact on a population level will require consistently safe sexual practices to maintain the protective benefit.  to make my point clear, i'll point out that the last sentence states that  *consistently safe sexual practices* are necessary to be protected from hiv.  more to the point, the circumcised men in the un studies are muslim. no doubt does this cultural affiliation have an effect on their sexual behavior and would explain why these circumcised men are at a reduced risk of hiv.  furthermore, consider [this article](http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news-1/role-of-circumcision-in-reducing-hiv-risk-still-unclear-27082-1/) that states circumcision does not decrease the risk of contracting hiv for gay men. then consider [the following study](http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/meetingabstracts/ma?f=102180172.html) that shows many gay men engage in unsafe sexual practices.  also, the u.s. has the highest rate of circumcision among industrialized nations (not considering, say, israel), and yet the u.s. hiv incidence rate is 3.5 times higher than that of the closest advanced industrialized nation.  therefore, it is obvious that the un studies are hindered by confounding variables and that the real solution to the spread of hiv (and other stds) is not circumcision, but sexually responsible behavior.  &gt; **almost complete elimination of invasive penile cancer.**  however, penile cancer occurs in *old men* and at an extremely small incidence. the national cancer institute of the u.s. expected a 2008 incidence of 1250 cases. for the u.s., that's rougly:      1250 / 305186613 \* 100% = 0.00041%  [wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penile_cancer):  &gt; penile cancer is very rare in europe and north america, occurring in about one in 100,000 men in the latter. it accounts for 0.2% of cancers and 0.1% of deaths from cancer amongst males in the united states.  moreover, it is generally thought that carcinoma of the penis is caused by viruses like hpv and other diseases that result from sexually irresponsible behavior and extremely poor hygiene.  &gt; **decrease in urological problems generally.**  this is so vague, all i can do is respond in kind: this is nonsense, and you know it.  ***besides, you are completely discounting the disadvantages***  through science and medicine, the foreskin is known to contain specialized structures, muscle, a complex vascular system, and  tens of thousands of highly concentrated, specialized, erogenous nerve cells and fine touch receptors[\[0\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/)[\[1\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/). these specialized structures include the preputial sphincter, the frenulum, and the ridged band. in particular, the frenulum is a very erogenous region that is either ablated during circumcision or is underdeveloped on the circumcised penis. the ridged band's fine touch receptors complement the coarse sensory receptors of the glans (head of the penis) and it is always removed during circumcision.  besides nerves, the foreskin acts as an erogenous sheath in which the shaft and glans glide and with which the frenulum and ridged band are stimulated.  the foreskin provides not just more sensitivity, but *enhanced* sensitivity.  these structures and nerves are essential to the complete experience and functioning of the sex act, so that their amputation results in a clear sensory and mechanical deficiency.  as for empirical data, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that the foreskin is highly erogenous and greatly enhances the sexual experience by providing another 'layer' of stimulation and function. [one study](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/ohara/) showed that 6/7 women prefer coitus with an intact penis.  consider this: i am red-green colorblind and i had no idea that i am deficient until i got to college and somebody [posted a joke similar to this one](http://www.tshirthell.com/shirts/products/a559/a559_bm.gif); for 20 years, i had no idea that i am unable to enjoy various colors and their combinations.  we don't even need silly tests like those dots. we could examine dna or the eye's cone cells and determine that a person is colorblind; these are physical facts.  likewise, there is no debate that circumcision destroys sexual 'perception'. the only question is whether the remaining tissue (glans and what's left of the inner foreskin) is desensitized due to the conditions engendered by the amputation of the foreskin. while there is conflicting evidence as to the degree of further desensitizing, it is certainly the case that the glans and remaining inner foreskin are transformed into fully external structures---something that is unnatural for these mucosal tissues. they suffer from drying-out, subtle lifelong abrasion (simple contact with clothes), and keratinization (a response that reduces the irritation of drying-out and abrasion, but also results in a reduction of nerve stimulation; intact men, who find themselves to be too sensitive are often instructed to retract their foreskins for intervals of time in order to dull their senses).  worse, the circumcised penis is often scarred and marked and dried-out---it looks weathered. with an incidence rate as high or higher than the problems it doesn't actually prevent, circumcision causes complications like skin bridges, skin tunnels, discoloration (the 'ring' where lots of tissue should be), hair on the shaft, skin so tight it causes the skin to break and scar upon erection, scars so inelastic that the penis bends on erection, loss of the highly erogenous frenulum (it is always underdeveloped on circumcised penises anyway), and even penis amputation and death.  all of these physical complications cause psychological stress.  just give birth to your son and take him home as he was born: healthy and whole. to forcibly circumcise a defenseless baby boy is to slight his human rights, dignity, respect, and personal liberty.",0,,

111864,"i am undecided on this issue. what i do feel comfortable claiming is this:  if you think education and/or healthcare is a public good in the same way that a court/police system and national defense are, you must be prepared for both of them to be administered in the form of a completely government run system. for example: a fair trial is an inalienable right that the government must provide in every situation. even if you are an esperanto-understanding deaf-blind mute, the government is required to meet every single one of your needs, no matter what the cost, so that you can participate in your defense. the government is also required to make every effort to educate you, no matter how severe your handicap is, or how many costly experts it take. in my experience, most people (not most libertarians, most people), are actually willing to accept this, and i think even in libertarian circles this view garners some sympathy. for better or for worse, we seem to have reached the point where public education that ensures children have the ability to participate in society and meet the requirements that division of labor imposes has the same existential implications for a nation as a military (that is, without either, the state would eventually collapse).  this is the way a state-granted right must work for it to meet the definition of a right. so, if healthcare is a public good, you must be prepared to say that every disease, no matter how rare, and every potential healing measure, no matter how costly, must be taken at public expense to guarantee this right. even if a disease is the product of a personal choice, e.g. smoking-related lung cancer or obesity-related adult-onset diabetes, people would be forced to have their property taken to subsidize another person's lifestyle choice. this is the reason i think most people are wary of saying healthcare is a public good.  related:  this is why i get angrier at defenders of obamacare than i do at supporters of a public option. at least public option supporters are philosophically consistent; obamacare supporters are in favor of what is essentially a massive sweetheart give-away to insurance companies. healthcare is too damn expensive, and a large part of the blame lies with insurance companies. yet, people seem to think that giving corporations more money is somehow preferable to repealing the anti-competitive laws that gave them state privilege to raise prices in the first place.  edit: typo.",1,,-1
177098,"iama human rights lawyer in canada with colleagues who argued the ""one person, one fare"" case judicially considering this very issue in 2008. in canada, we view this as a human rights issue. any service provider (business, government) has a duty to accommodate persons with disability to the point of ""undue hardship,"" meaning that it would place an undue burden on the service provider to accommodate the disabled person. a really common example would consider whether a small business has to build a wheel-chair accessible ramp or bathroom.   as regards flight operators, the canada transportation agency applied the federal human rights code and the ""undue hardship"" test and found that there is no undue burden placed on airlines to accommodate persons with disabilities who require two seats. this can include not only particularly large people who are disabled because of their obesity or co-morbidities, but also persons who require personal attendants to fly (or bus, or rail) with them (such persons being described in policy, including persons who are both deaf and blind, those with intellectual disabilities, persons with sever mobility restrictions, etc.). in fact, much less an ""undue burden"", the cta held that the total number of trips requiring this form of accommodation would amount to merely %0.32 of all domestic trips taken via airplane. a significant factor at play in their analysis is the fact that persons with disabilities simply travel a lot less than the general population because of the impact their disabilities have on their levels of employment, income and living standards.   the one person, one fare decision is based on longstanding principles of equal access to transportation services for persons with disabilities, regardless of the nature of the disability. you can read a rather concise summary of the judgment [here](http://www.otc-cta.gc.ca/doc.php?did=2168&amp;lang=eng) or read the judgment itself [here](http://www.otc-cta.gc.ca/decision-ruling/drv.php?id=26872&amp;lang=eng).   on a completely separate tack, i though redditors where smart enough to know that you never put minority issues to a vote (including public opinion polls) because they'll always lose (compare to the recent history of gay marriage in california).  **edit** *six hours later, in reply to some of the comments and themes raised:*  1) the cta judgment goes to great lengths to clarify what separates obesity from disability. you can't just be fat and claim that you need two seats. the request for accommodation has to be: linked to a disability, which would include protected grounds expressly defined under the human rights code; connected to the legal definition of disability which, depending on the circumstance, may be ""an immutable personal characteristic""; and which means that discrimination would occur ""but for"" the accommodation. it is essentially an argument about barriers and equal access: ""but for"" the lack of two seats, would this person be barred from enjoying access to flight services like an able bodied person? in reality, that is a pretty high threshold test to meet. a person who is simply obese is not barred from using and airplane and faces no particular barriers, although they may be physically uncomfortable. the same analysis applies for particularly tall people. the courts aren't stupid. despite the best efforts of pundits to be uselessly reductive and argue the ""slippery slope"" until the cows come home, there's never going to be a judgment that says ""give whoever wants two seats their two seats."" that's just not what the law says, so the haters might as well stop pretending to get so incensed that it does.   the other aspect worth mentioning is that asserting your rights as a disabled person often takes a great deal of courage to simply be who you are. many people are too afraid of the stigma associated with being disabled to assert that they require accommodation. in fact, it's usually the other way around: disabled people often try to be as ""normal"" as possible to avoid being singled out. there is a huge social pressure attached to being different, ""a freak"", ""a loser"", ""a fag"", ""ugly"", a ""fat bitch"" or having ""no self control.""   finally, in addition to the legal analysis above, if you are truly tall enough that you literally can't fit in the seats provided, you may well be facing ""constructive discrimination"" on the basis of an immutable physical attribute. i'd have to check the case law on this to see what it says though. but in any case, as ludicrous as it may sound to the doubters, and in all seriousness, i think we all have a vested interest in breaking through the preconception that there is a ""normal"" or ""standard"" human being. why airlines can't simply designate a row of seats specifically for persons requiring some form of accommodation (be they tall or obese, otherwise disabled or accompanied by an attendant, etc.) i don't really understand. i can only assume it's that extra 0.32% profit motive. but does that have to be?

""obesity"" is not defined as a protected ground under the human rights code. in my use of the term, i was referring to those who are obese and disabled, which is a protected ground. as the cta held (and these numbers were vigorously vetted at trial) this amounts to a fairly small minority of the population. second, the essence of discrimination is socially valuing (or undervaluing) an immutable personal characteristic. so for the purposes on truly understanding the law of discrimination and accommodation, you have to appreciate that by definition we are always talking about a minority of people or a group of people who are made minoritarian and discriminated against by the values placed on their personal characteristics by someone in a position of power or privilege to do so.",1,,2

386306,"**----u.s. history----**  first, you must understand that 'routine' circumcision became prevalent in the united states not for legitimate medical reasons, but for religiously based pseudo-medicine and superstition.  in particular, circumcision was advocated as a way to curb masturbation, because such ""self-abuse"" was regarded as a sin against god and one of the main causes for all manner of physical and mental illness, including blindness and epilepsy.  in fact, [one of the major proponents of circumcision](http://www.circumstitions.com/kellogg.html) in the u.s. stated that one of the bonuses of the amputation is the pain, because it serves as a corporal reminder of the ills of sexual stimulation.  this is of course all rubbish. as previously mentioned, studies have shown that circumcised men actually masturbate more frequently than intact men--likely, because of the constant (unwanted) stimulation of their exposed glans and remaining inner foreskin and frenulum. also, circumcised men are more likely to participate in more exotic sexual behavior such as anal sex and fellatio, which is perhaps due to a sensory inbalance that requires a more exotic stimulation of the brain (note, this is not to say that anal sex or fellatio are 'deviant').  nevertheless, once routine amputation of the foreskin became prevalent, the medical establishment sought to associate it with legitimate medical benefits.  **----hygiene----**  general ease of hygiene was an early stated benefit of circumcision. however, the intact penis requires no special treatment. because the nascent foreskin of children is fused to the glans (even up to late adolescence), children require only external cleaning. in the adult, the foreskin retracts so easily, that rinsing during a shower is not even a conscious effort.  simply put, hygiene is no reason for circumcision; the majority of the earth's men would find this claim laughable.  **----phimosis/paraphimosis----**  this now pretty much understood to be a result of forced retraction of a child's nascent foreskin; [that is to say, the majority of these cases were caused by poor medical advice or meddling parents](http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/info/info-forcedretraction.html)  also, many cases of phimosis in children are likely wrongly diagnosed, as indicated in the [british journal of medicine](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/) (search for 'phimosis').  **----infections----**  (for citations, see http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/uti)  another often listed benefit of circumcision is the prevention of urinary tract infections (utis); like most pro-circumcision talking points, this notion mainly came as the result of dubious studies. however, infants are at a higher risk for uti in the weeks following circumcision, as confirmed by studies in israel. besides the fact that utis are generally easy to cure and infrequent, the incidence of infection are roughly the same between an intact boy and a circumcised boy.  moreover, the intact adult is less likely to suffer from a uti than a circumcised adult male, likely because the meatus of the circumcised penis is constantly and directly exposed to the environment.  some doctors recommend circumcision in cases of recurrent uti. however, there is no medical evidence to support this recommendation. recurrent utis are associated with congenital abnormalities of the upper urinary tract. indeed, the national kidney and urologic diseases clearinghouse (nkudic), a service of the national institutes of health does not suggest circumcision as a prevention or cure of urinary tract infection.  it is also interesting to consider girls. a recent scandinavian study found that girls and boys have about the same incidence of uti in the first year of life. girls have a four times higher incidence of uti in the first six years of life than non-circumcised boys. no special concern is manifested regarding this much higher rate of infection in girls...  why don't we alter the genitalia of girls?  worse, circumcised infants are at an increased risk for mrsa infections, and recent israeli studies confirm that infants are at an increased risk of utis in the weeks after ritual circumcision. (http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/doc/mrsa.html)  therefore, circumcision is not a suitable reason to provide for reducing the risk of utis or other infections.  **----stds/hiv----**  very recently, hiv/aids has replaced utis as the scare-tactic for promoting amputation of the foreskin. however, safe sexual practices are not only essential, but they are the only reliable and effective means for controlling and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases; even though the un's recent (u.s.-led) studies suggest that circumcision reduces the incidence of hiv infection, the un still acknowledges that only sex education and sexually responsible behavior (such as using condoms) are effective solutions.  in fact, [one meta-study of those un studies](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120747249/abstract?cretry=1&amp;sretry=0) suggests that 72 circumcisions are necessary in order to prevent one case of hiv infection. in conclusion, the researches make a half-hearted endorsement of the procedure:  ""male circumcision is an effective strategy for reducing new male hiv infections. its impact on a population level will require consistently safe sexual practices to maintain the protective benefit.""  consider that last sentence again: ""consistently safe sexual practices"" are necessary to be protected from hiv.  more to the point, the circumcised men in the un studies are muslim. no doubt does this cultural affiliation have an effect on their sexual behavior and would explain why these circumcised men are at a reduced risk of hiv.  also, [consider research](http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news-1/role-of-circumcision-in-reducing-hiv-risk-still-unclear-27082-1/) that shows circumcision does not decrease the risk of contracting hiv for gay men. then [consider a study](http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/meetingabstracts/ma?f=102180172.html) that shows many gay men engage in unsafe sexual practices.  therefore, it is obvious that the un studies are hindered by confounding variables and that the real solution to the spread of hiv (and other stds) is not circumcision, but sexually responsible behavior.  furthermore, the u.s. has the highest rate of circumcision among industrialized nations (not considering, say, israel), and yet the u.s. hiv incidence rate is 3.5 times higher than that of the closest advanced industrialized nation.  **----penile cancer----**  another claim is that circumcision protects boys from penile cancer. however, penile cancer occurs in *old men* and at an extremely small incidence. the national cancer institute of the u.s. expected a 2008 incidence of 1250 cases. for the u.s., that's rougly:      1250 / 305186613 * 100% = 0.00041%  according to [wikipedia (and the sources it lists)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penile_cancer):  ""penile cancer is very rare in europe and north america, occurring in about one in 100,000 men in the latter. it accounts for 0.2% of cancers and 0.1% of deaths from cancer amongst males in the united states.""  moreover, it is generally thought that carcinoma of the penis is caused by viruses like hpv and other diseases that result from sexually irresponsible behavior and extremely poor hygiene.  **----cervical cancer----**  some studies have linked the presence of the foreskin to an increased risk of cervical cancer for women.  however, this is a problem of causation and correlation. the studies compared statistics of cervical cancer between jewish and gentile populations. while the rates were still relatively low for both, jewish women seemed to be at an advantage.  it was claimed that smegma around an unclean foreskin was to blame, however, this is now known to be false even though it is still disseminated. in particular, women produce smegma too.  today, it is now well understood that cervical cancer is caused mostly by hpv, an std that can be easily avoided with sexually responsible behavior.  is it not possible that, for cultural reasons, the jewish population is more sexually responsible than average? or is it not possible that hpv hadn't yet penetrated to the jewish population as much?  in any case, it is clear that the presence of a foreskin has nothing to do with women's cervical cancer and everything to do with poor sexual responsibility and viruses.  **----conclusion----**  in short, circumcision is derived from the true but misguided insight that removing a body part prevents problems with that body part. yet, these problems are not inherent in the foreskin; in fact, the foreskin is valuable itself.  the american academy of pediatrics (aap) has more or less condemned 'routine' (neonatal) circumcision since 1971; in 1999 the aap strengthened this stance. also, the ama recognizes that medically unnecessary circumcision has no therapeutic benefit. the rest of the world agrees. in fact, none of the following medical societies/associations endorses medically unnecessary circumcision, and they recognize that there is no appreciable prophylactic or therapeutic benefits:  * american academy of pediatrics * american medical association * american cancer society * centers for disease control and prevention * national institutes of health * pediatric urologists association * american college of obstetricians and gynecologists * canadian pediatric society * canadian medical association * australian medical societies * european medical societies (any)  more importantly, circumcision is a slight against human rights, dignity, respect, and personal liberty.  just leave your son the way he was born: healthy and whole. be open with him about how his healthy penis is supposed to function and teach him to be sexually safe and clean. set it and forget it.... it's just that easy.",0,,
363225,"agreed, but i think it's the work of a lot of ""geniuses"".  however, this works out fine in practice.  hiring is tremendously difficult at any type of senior position.  it's very hard to find bodies just to fill positions, let alone people who can run projects to completion.  if you pick up the skills to do that, which is totally independent of any employment history you've had, then you can get another job.  it took another set of geniuses to make everyone want a ""stable"" job, instead of just working for themselves, as everyone but slaves/indentured servants used to.  it helps that land is closely zoned as well.  :)  anyway, i think unions are overrated for this purpose, because they are for low-skilled workers who need to move together and dont have job mobility.  there could certainly be a place for unions in the industry, but for highly skilled workers it would be a major drag to have some behemoth trying to help us out, when we're capable of moving around to a better position anyway.  there is a lot to be said for independence, once you can get it.  if you cant, better to have strength in numbers.",0,,

219315,"sorry i'm late responding to you. your comment got caught in a massive backlog and i've been busy lately. i put it off for a couple days and before i knew it another week had passed.  no, they don't have to *earn* the right to not be called disabled. some people are fortunate enough to be born with conditions that are curable/fixable. some deaf folks can get cochlear implants. that's great! we're on the verge of curing some forms of blindness. we may soon be able to let paraplegics walk with the help of robotic assistance, and work is being done on spinal-cord repair that's promising. i simply mean that, if you're born with a condition that takes away or severely impairs your ability to do something, you can often work towards being just as capable as anyone else, or have medical assistance to restore or repair your disability.  &gt; my cousin is deaf. she can read lips well. she can speak. she also signs. she worked hard to be able to do some of the things that come very easy to many of us. she has a great job, as a manager in retail. she has hobbies. she supports herself and her step-children. does that sound like someone who is ""disabled"" to you?  your cousin is adapting to her environment. she's still deaf. she's still not operating through normal channels. it's great that she adapted well. she's still disabled. something is functioning incorrectly, and she's working around that.  &gt; and i'm not saying this because she's some hero. she's not an inspirational lifetime movie. yeah, she worked hard, but she didn't need to earn some right to not be disabled. being deaf doesn't make her special.  no, it didn't. but it does make her deaf. and severe deafness is a disability because it impairs the way she functions. there's still going to be situations where she's at a disadvantage because of her condition.  &gt; to be labeled as someone to be pitied, or weird, or sad, or somehow less than ""normal""  nobody's labeling anyone pitiful, weird, or sad. i'm sure some cases of disability are sad. i'm sure some people with disabilities are deserving of pity, and maybe even enjoy receiving it (though i find pity insulting, myself), and i assure you the last thing i want is anyone pointing fingers and labeling anyone as ""weird"" because of something out of their control.  but they're still missing something that you can generalize ""everyone"" else as having. something we can say you're ""intended"" to have (to whatever extent nature can intend things) but failed to receive. and of course, many disabled become so later on in life.  my point isn't really a point about disabilities. it's a point about labels, which are stupid to have in the first place, but can be handy at times. and that point is as follows: letting people decide their own labels effectively renders an already silly concept entirely pointless. if people are going to choose what categories they fall into, then there's literally no point in even having descriptive categories at all. they're meaningless. this is a broader problem than the disabled. but we can start small. for every disabled person who wants to *not* be called disabled, there's another who *does*, because it tells people who they are and has become their identity. which *is* kind of sad in my opinion, but to each their own. if your legs don't work because you broke your spine falling down a staircase, then you can't wake up and decide that you're still the same person you were the day before. you can't decide you're *not* disabled, because you can still go everywhere and use your hands to drive and... you get the idea. you still fall into this category of distinguishment. there's a very real and very physical reason you're in that category. and if you start letting that definition slip, like saying ""blind people aren't disabled!"" or ""fat people above a certain weight are disabled!"" just to push some agenda, then you're ruining the entire reason we've made that label.  there's no *shame* in being disabled. none at all. but it's still going to be a part of who you are. should it be your primary identity? no. but there's a lot of labels people form their entire identity around when they shouldn't. most of them very aesthetic and shallow. i'm not saying anyone should treat you different. i'm not saying anyone should act differently around you. that would be silly. in fact, i'd argue that the disabled should be treated more normal than they are; a lot of people go out of their way to cater to them and put them on this pedestal as wonderful little miracle troopers. it's silly. just meet them halfway and if they have issues and need help don't be a dick and deprive them. but don't go out of your way to try to ""save"" them, either.  labels are the metadata of life. they're utterly meaningless for day-to-day activities, and shouldn't affect your behavior at all. but they're still okay to have around, at least for now. but if we're going to have them, they need to mean something. if your friend can wake up and be deaf, but not ""disabled"", solely over the implication of the label's *name*, then i can wake up as basically anything. there's already people out there who are claiming they identify as another race, or nationality, or a beaver, or made-up sexual labels. if i had a dime for every christian i've met who says they're ""not a christian, [they] just believe jesus wants us to love each other""...  point being, some people fit into categories. and those categories *should* be meaningless as far as how we treat people. the label name or you fitting into it isn't the problem. the issue is that people take them way too seriously sometimes. so the least we can do is give those categories some criteria and just ask that, if you're going to claim to be one thing, you meet some basic requirements.  as an addendum, not to be a dick about things, but i do feel that having a disability does in fact make you physically ""less than whole"". i know that's a controversial opinion, but i feel it's important to point out that nobody's physical condition is equivalent. i'm sure there's some dude in a wheelchair who could crush me with his upper-body strength. but the ""not having legs"" thing is still detrimental. if you were going to give people scores, they'd definitely be taking some kind of penalty. but there's a *huge* difference between ""this person's body is inherently weaker to start with"" and ""this person is worthy of people treated as a lesser"". i don't really believe in lessers. i don't believe that a person's physical condition has anything to do with how you treat someone. and to echo my sentiment above, i really do think if you're judging people and treating them based solely on labels, you're probably a big fat jerk. having a disability doesn't make you any less of a person. but it's certainly not to your benefit on some level. and i don't think that those two concepts have to be mutually exclusive.",1,,2

754528,"sure...  take all this with a grain of salt because ianal just a landlord who's been through this a few times in civil court.   basically- there are a few different categories of ""service dog"" and they all tend to get lumped together because people (both tenants and landlord) aren't clear about the laws.  it's a murky area and i've found even some housing attorneys aren't clear about it.   also landlords tend to be in my experience very paranoid about the ada, so the minute someone says ""service dog"" or ""therapy dog"" they back right off and allow the tenant to move in/get the dog.  we have a little more leeway than that.  just be wary of googling about it because there is a lot of inaccurate information out there about the regulations and a lot of bs on the web about it.  there are also a bunch of websites telling people how to fake qualify their dog as a bs service dog and sadly predatory scam places selling fake service dog credentials, harnesses etc for huge markups.   it all really sucks for the people who actually need the service dogs, because all this makes landlords hella skeptical of anyone claiming to need a service dog.   category 1:  medical service dog- dog provides a specific function for a specific disability.  so, guide dog for a blind person, seizure alert dog for an epileptic person, hyperglycemic sniffing diabetic alert dog, stability support dog for an amputee, etc.     here is where it gets interesting and where a lot of the confusion comes from- as a housing provider, you are allowed to inquire about the nature of the disability and the specific function the dog provides the tenant to alleviate that disability.  you can request proof of the disability.  this can be a ssdi payment, etc.  to warrant a service dog, the person has to qualify as disabled enough to no longer perform normal activities of daily living without the support of the dog.  so, a trumped up letter from a doc saying tenant needs fido for his opiate addiction is not going to fly.  it has to be a legitimate, verified disability... disabled enough not to perform normal activities of daily living.   the dog does not have to be certified through an organization but you can request documentation about the tasks performed by and training of the dog.  what differs from landlords vs someone running a grocery store is because we are a housing provider, hud laws are different than ada laws... so basically if someone says they have a service dog in a restaurant, the restaurant owner can't inquire further, but a housing provider is allowed to request proof/documentation/verification yadda yadda.   another way you can disqualify a bs service dog:  even if they have a documented disability and proof of requiring a service dog for a specific function, you can still prevent the dog based on breed restrictions.  basically, the ada only requires you to allow the dog within ""reasonable accommodation"" and if allowing a service dog pitbull (or whatever breed they want if it's on the breed restricted list) is going to invalidate your building's insurance policy, you are still allowed to reject the disabled tenant and their dog.    so in my case, i was allowed to reject an english bull terrier because they were on my insurance carriers aggressive breed list.    category ii:  emotional support animals.  doesn't have to be a dog.  can be a cat, parrot, goat, whatever.  these are animals whose mere presence helps alleviate mental illness.  dogs not trained in any specific way, their function is to help emotional condition of owner.  not protected by the ada.  this can be a depression dog or a ptsd dog, etc.  don't have to allow.  see more [here](https://adata.org/publication/service-animals-booklet).   category iii:  therapy animals/therapy dog- these are dogs who are trained to provide therapeutic relief to other people than the owner... so for example if they took the dog and volunteered with it at an alzheimer ward of a skilled nursing facility.  dogs are rigorously trained and verified by organizations like the delta society or the spca.  not protected by ada or hud, don't have to allow them.   and all this is moot in certain cases......  i'm not saying everyone with a service dog is lying and trying to scam, but there are a lot of people around here who are.   if i have a tenant with an actual legitimate disability, i will happily allow the service dog.  currently i have two tenants with dogs- a hearing alert corgi for a deaf tenant in one of my properties and a veteran with a ptsd emotional support dog in another... it's more that i can't let every tom dick and harry who wants to get a dog decide to get one then make up some fake disability and try to pass the dog off.    if any lawyers or other landlords with more experience/knowledge about this want to chime in and correct me on anything, feel free!",1,,1

280762,"i speculate that it has more to do with the different ways we approach production. as stated before, japan values cost effectiveness and efficiency. in the us, we like spectacle. our most cherished animated features pay great attention to detail and we utilize most of our expression through the face.  think about [this scene from the lion king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xku23m6yx04) just watch the first 3 seconds. it's not him at his most expressive, but even then, look at how much motion there is and how it makes him feel more real and fluid. now, watch the rest of the video and watch how his face moves and how the shapes change as he speaks and sings. it is obviously exaggerated form what real life looks like, but the exaggeration give a spectacle to the whole thing that makes it gripping to watch.   &amp;#x200b;  now, look at spirited away. it's amazing, a fantastic example of animation from japan. look at sen's face vs yubaba's. which is more fluid and which brings more life to the character. protip: yubaba. step to a lower grade production: naruto. people talk, but unless they use a large motion for something dramatic, it doesn't have the same expressiveness.  &amp;#x200b;  japaneese storytelling through animation differs from western in that they focus on other things to convey the scene. the tension, the gravity, the importance, all of it comes from elsewhere. it's a common complaint that most anime is ""just people grunting and looking intensely at something"" and that complain is made with good reason. those dramatic poses and grunting bits chew up screen time and when scored with the right music add tension, but my problem (my opinion) is that they're relying on the soundtrack too heavily to make up for ""cut corners"".  &amp;#x200b;  an interesting experiment that just came to mind: mute youtube (no subtitles either) and only watch the physical motions of an episode of an anime vs and episode from an american show. study the physical movements overall and see how they differ. you can repeat with a major film from both styles as well (howl's moving castle and frozen?).",0,,

169381,"&gt;how do you get a quadriplegic to work? or someone born deaf/blind? or someone with cystic fibrosis, leukemia, ms, muscular dystrophy or any number of crippling conditions.  there are many disabilities that prevent people from working. that does not mean that ever disabled person has no capacity to do useful work. for those few who are disabled, it is the responsibility of those who brought them into existence (if they are born with a disability) or their family members (if they later developed the disability) to take care of them. you are more than welcome to help them if you want, but it is not the responsibility of everyone to help those people. besides, my point was that government regulation hurts more disabled people than it helps. you still haven't addressed that.  &gt;in your world: they starve and die in the street.  do you not have anyone that cares about you? i would hope someone does :s  &gt;you then say the problem anyhow: why would anyone hire them if there's an an able bodied person around?   because if it wasn't for government regulation (minimum wage), you can hired disabled people for less. but since there is regulation, it doesn't actually help any disabled people; i just choose to skip them altogether and hire a normal person.  &gt;i don't believe someone should be punished for being born with a disease, or having an accident (either physical or genetic).  you should not be, at least not for the accident. the person who caused it should be punished. that's why there are courts in this country. use them.  in terms of genetics, if you carry genes that make you predisposed to certain mutations or diseases, then it is desirable for the human race to not have you pass on those genes.  &gt;education: everyone pays taxes, therefore everyone contributed to anyone who gets educated.  the problem is that not everyone receives an equal education. take california for example, the richest 25% of californians represent about 50% of the uc (publicly funded) population. the poorest 25%, on the other hand, represent about 5% of the population. everyone pays taxes, but these state tax dollars allocated to education has overwhelmingly benefitted the rich. how is that fair to those poor people who paid taxes but can not or choose not to go to college?  &gt;it's a necessary thing for everyone and you don't owe the very rich for that  you shouldn't owe anyone except your educators. they should be able to charge what they like.  &gt;the usa has a different model and has shunned govt provided public health.  bullshit. the us has embraced managed care since the early 1900s. let's start with the american medical association. the ama lobbied for government protection, which it got. the ama is the sole organization that can license doctors in the united states. after receiving this monopoly power from the government, the ama worked to close medical schools and decrease the amount of new doctors (a plan that succeeded). this ensured that there would be a constant shortage of healthcare in the us and prices would have to increase. if you read into problems (rather than just glean the surface), you almost always find that some private entity with a government granted monopoly (or government itself) is the problem.  had the us went with a true free market system of healthcare, there would be no ama monopoly on doctors licenses. the supply of doctors would increase greatly, and everyone knows, once supply increases, prices decrease.  &gt;compared to every other developed nation which has public health it has resulted in a failure to provide value, failure to improve life and failure to improve health.  it's broken, yes. but government run managed care is just more of the same. we should be moving in the opposite direction.  &gt;justice: another childish view of how it works. ""you work it out with the perpetrator"" - who forces that perpetrator to come to court, who ensures punishment is carried out.. oh, you pay for that? what if you don't have money - you don't get justice. justice for the rich only is not justics: it's plutocracy.  i did say don't privatize everything. privatize the police force but not the doj. some limited form of government should still exist. what i don't want is big government overreaching into the private lives of individual citizens.  &gt;you seem to not understand how a job works.  you seem to not understand what rights are. rights can **not** be taken away. therefore, if education was a right, teachers must teach when requested. just as how free speech is not only protect for certain groups of individuals and at specific locations within the country, the ""right of education"" would have to apply anywhere and anytime to anyone for it to be a right. i fail to see how you can get education (which requires teachers to work) when there is little/no pay.  &gt;they do not have to teach at any hour of day for no pay etc.  i would like to exercise my right to education and it's 3:00am local time. can you please inform me of a teacher who is willing to work? also, i am not paying for this. please get back to me asap.  &gt;heard of books? courses etc?  ever seen free ones floating around? anywhere you do (such as libraries) the poor already have the same access as we do. i don't get your point.  &gt;my ideology helps everyone in society:  no it doesn't. it caters to the middle class at the expense of the rich and the poor. such is the result of most political movements.  &gt;and even then: won't work for that long. e.g. without a healthy, educated population of not-stinking-rich workers industry and commerce can't function.  then i am sure ""the rich"" are willing to invest in healthcare and for others, since our own best interests are to do so. no? we don't need laws to tell us things that are demonstrably beneficial to ourselves. most of us get by without a law requiring regular breathing.  &gt;people are born sick, people get permanently sick/hurt so they can't work: what about them.  they are to be taken care of by their family members. also, even if they can't produce value, they demand goods and services. they still need food, clothing, shelter, etc. these demands create jobs for able bodied individuals in the society.  &gt;saying a person should have bought insurance/saved is stupid: let's say they haven't, couldn't or did but then got screwed somehow (e.g. like the us health insurance providers do all the time because they are chasing dollars rather than healthcare).  as shitty as us insurance is, their profit margins aren't all that great. the average profit margin falls short of the average of the fortune 500 companies. the real problem is third party payments. we don't pay for our own healthcare, it's deducted from your paycheck or paid by medicare/medicaid. the lack of price as a tool to distribute healthcare leads to excess demand. as we demand more, prices go up. the insurance companies are simply passing these cost rises to us by raising our premiums. documented cases (like those in sicko) about firms dropping clients after the client got sick should be investigated though.  &gt;free market places money as the only valued commodity.  money is worthless. we want the goods that we can trade for money. the free market values every commodity that is useful to us.  &gt;socialist concepts realise this and the combination of a bit of capitalism, bit of socialism yields best result.  you know what else is a bit socialist and a bit capitalist? the us healthcare system. socialist doctors (government granted ama monopoly) and capitalist insurance companies. look where that's leading us right now. i'm looking forward to more of this in other industries [/sarcasm].",1,,0

359497,"&gt;i'd say this is very aptly worded, but you'd not care haha! though that's exactly the whole problem of creative ""professionals"" social sites: people would rather congratulate and pat each others backs than discuss shit :/  you do bring up a good point that i also forgot. since most comment threads on portfolio sites are built out like a blog article you really can't go in depth and do something longform like my post. which i also assume means that people fear being succinct in a negative way, because you can easily come off as a dick.  &gt;same about the over-saturation too. i'm in my second year of study now and if any of the content from peers goes up for critique... no-one would ever point out any flaws or poor use of design fundamentals. just ""pat pat, you did good! this and that looks nice"".  this one might just be people getting used to constructive critique. i'll admit that when i was in my second year i was very much like this. i was nice, partly because i didn't want to be mean, and partly because i really didn't know how to give constructive feedback just yet. sure, i could explain what i liked, and what i didn't like, but i wasn't at the stage where i was good enough with my wording to explain what could be improved, and what next steps needed to be done.   &gt;it gets to the point where we're in our comfort zone, so satisfied with our ""skills"" (or rather lack of), so we don't seek to improve beyond that.  for me, this changed around my senior year and post education in the working world. during my final year was when i was making my portfolio to be used for interviews, and i noticed that while i was decent at my art school, i wasn't the best. normally, this should still be good. my program was really good, but at this time i shifted focus on improving myself internally instead of being fueled by external validation.  this mean that i was never satisfied and was always looking to push my stuff further. it's a common trait for good creatives, this sense of always feeing inadequate and wanting to constantly learn and improve. the actual truth is that you'll never feed this beast; if you fundamentally feel like you're inadequate, there's not really a light at the end of the tunnel that signals that you've ""made it"". cause each level you move up to means that there's another peak to aim for.  which is why every year or so i take a step back and look at my portfolio and work and compare it to my previous years. only then do i realize that i've learned and grown significantly and that real progress has been made.   you bring up this point:  &gt;they (and myself, i'm guilty too) would rather collect fake approval from peers, and our five minutes of fame online, over talking about stuff.  i really think that the main reason why i'm successful now is because early on in my career i learned not to care about seeking approval in this way. i changed my perception of thinking about progress as less about how many likes or pats on the back i got, and more only on how satisfied i was personally on my work. because of that, it's been good because every time i do a piece of work or try to learn something new, it's not because of trends or to fuel my ego, but rather that i know myself well enough to see where i have flaws and room to improve and work on that.   a couple years of this meant that i was became very well rounded, skilled in my specific type of design and have work that is more timeless than my peers' portfolios.",0,,

that's not the case. a lot of the time the anger and frustration comes from a place of trying to fix something, and people digging their heels in, denying it, because if it was a problem and they didn't realize and they were complicit in it, then they are a bad person, and they are not, so it mustn't actually be a problem or be as bad as the other person says it is, or they're uncomfortable with the hurt/anger from the other person - so it's easier to turn it around and blame them.  and no, i don't trust a lot of able bodied people when it comes to disability issues. it doesn't mean that i think people are ill intentioned, but i do know that we are much less further along in terms of understanding disability and ableism than we think we are (we are still expected to hate our bodies, and want to fix them, and want to be ""normal"" ). and i do get angry, yeah - but that anger stops me from curling up in a small ball every day. because so many people claim to get it, and claim to not be ableist when they are. i know that the education system fucked me and a lot of other people up and continues to do so to this day (kpmg did a report a few years ago  on the state of accessibility in education, and you can't trust their ""end finding"" because if you read the report none of their findings within the actual report actually support it). i know i've still got internalized ableism. i know i don't know everything and so if someone who has a lived experience in something i don't have says ""this is problematic"" i listen, i take it seriously. but i constantly work with, have conversations with, and experience things with non-disabled people who insist they get it, and insist they couldn't be ableist, and insist the problems we are bringing up aren't as bad as we say they are, or in some cases that they actually exist. everytime i try to not act like that's not the case i get dismissed, i get ignored, i get blamed.  here's the thing - we're all ableist in one way or another. you know how i know who to trust? the people who get that. the fact that we are isn't our fault, but our refusal to admit it is. i still have to fight off judgement of less put together visibly disabled people in public because of this want for us to put on a ""good face"" so people have less reasons to discriminate and judge us. i still have to fight off thoughts and feelings about obese people because of how my childhood family doctor gave us really shitty treatment and ignored issues because she believed ""we were in as good shape as someone who was obese"" so just wouldn't bother and at the time i was like ""but we actually can't do anything to change the way we are"" - and my anger got partially transferred.   abortions and pro-choice stuff are a really tricky topic within the community. i will fully give you that. i completely believe in a woman's right to choose, and if someone feels they do not have the ability to raise a child? then yes, abortion can be one of the their options. however, the problem arises when it's an assumed solution, when it's a blanket solution. when it's a solution because of the myths surrounding whatever the disability is. when it's a solution because the parents wouldn't have access to supports and programs that would make them feel capable.  did you know that most babies with downs syndrome are aborted? it's in the range of 80% iirc. that when it's detected women, that it's often just assumed they will abort? that they go in with information about it immediately? i don't think my assertion about abortions are irrational, they're based in what is actually going on right now.",1,,2
358863,"i understand why it's offensive. to the cognitively-deficcient with abilities at least that of a 6 year old, then they're able to understand it as a playground insult. and kids can be very cruel.  here in the uk, when i was a kid, there was a children's tv programme which showed the life of a man, [joey deacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joey_deacon), who had severe cerebral palsy. he was, in the language of the time, a ""spastic"". because he had spent his life unable to communicate conventionally he was institutionalised, basically warehoused, thought to be a vegetable, until he met another palsy-sufferer who was able to understand him. with the help of his friends he dictated a book about his life and this was presented by the tv programme as triumph over adversity.  to quote the internet, *""unfortunately, the programme producers had not thought through the consequences of showing lengthy sequences of a drooling, grunting spastic at peak viewing time."" ""did [the bbc] forget how cruel small kids can be?""* at the time, even before this, i think, i was used to being asked ""is your sister a spastic"" and hearing from school acquaintances that their mothers had explained my sister was a ""spastic"". it was not previously a bad word, but it rapidly became one - if you did something stupid you were a ""spasmo"" or a ""joey""; every kid in the class had a joey deacon impression which involved uncontrollable shaking of the arms in a certain manner, facial ticks and so on.  to a disabled adult, today, who was in a wheelchair back then, or who suffered from any kind of muscle-control problems at that time - ""joey"" and ""[spastic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spastic#evolution_of_the_term_in_the_united_kingdom)"" are absolutely the worst words you can use to them. whilst able-bodied kids used these terms casually with each other, words can't really do justice to how *extremely* offensive and hurtful they were and are to kids who suffered disabilities.  now the thing is that there was a charity at the time called the spastics' society, dedicated to helping those with cerebral palsy and similar disabilities. in 1994 they changed their name to scope - one can imagine a marketing team coming up with such a term because it had no pre-existing connotations or brand associations. overnight, ""scoper"" became a new playground insult.  so i think a few people here have taken offence - or have been shocked - at me describing my sister as a ""retard"". and, you know, that would probably be totally inappropriate and hurtful and i'd probably never do it if she had the cognitive abilities of a 6 year old, had she suffered from teasing or persecution herself. when i was a kid the politically correct term for my sister was ""mentally handicapped""; now the correct term might be ""developmentally impaired"", i don't really know.  but the whole point of telling you the joey deacon story is that it's from misuse and cruelty that these terms become offensive. i spent my childhood explaining that my sister was ""mentally handicapped"" and exactly what that entailed, and feeling ""different"" and uncomfortable about it. why couldn't i just have had a normal family?  so i probably use the term ""retarded"", in real life, if i have occasion to mention my sister or my upbringing, somewhat defensively. i think i first justified using as calling a spade a spade, but i probably also use it to discourage questions and too much prying into a matter i'd rather not discuss too much. i'm sorry if that doesn't come across here on reddit.  for anyone saying that i shouldn't use that term out of sympathy for my sister - you clearly don't understand my sister's disability. there is absolutely no reason for sympathy for my sister, because she is such a happy little vegetable - she loves pop music on tv, the attention of her caregivers and certain foods. she laughs a lot.   perhaps i ought not to use the term, on occasion at least, out of consideration for other retards than my sister, and for their families. i'll consider that now.   i have no doubt that i had an upbringing that was privileged in many ways, and there are plenty of people that had it worse than me, but my childhood was not a particularly happy one. i'll also reiterate that my sister is not one of those who had it worse than me - she's really very happy.  i imagine that those who appear disgusted, offended or shocked by what i wrote before never had to live with ""having a retarded sister"" (as the subtitle of the book expresses it) and all i can say is that the presence of my sister was an aspect of my unhappy childhood, and if this book in any way fulfils its premise and is useful, then i wish i'd had it back then. because i had no idea really how to deal with it back then - it simply *was*, it was just a fact of life and i had to put up with it - and i don't really know that i know now how to deal with it, either. i don't ""hate"" my sister, as one commenter seems to think, but i have no affection for her, either. why should i? it's not possible for us to have any kind of normal sibling relationship, and i can only envy those that do have normal brothers and sisters they can spend time with.",1,,-1

(if you want to submit an interview, send me a dm.)  &amp;#x200b;  edited to add: i also wrote a guide for creating [dyslexia-friendly scripts](https://www.reddit.com/user/dominaexcrucior/comments/pujm55/dyslexiafriendly_scripts/). making your script more readable for dyslexic people is easy. üôÇ  &amp;#x200b;  üìØ i do not claim to be the expert on my disability, or anyone else's.  when i write about disabled characters, i normalize disability. i don't write pity fucks, i don't write comfort and reassurance. like with any other script, i just write about two people who are attracted to each other and want to have sex. full stop. while the story will include a few lines to make it clear that someone has a disability, the story is **not about** disability. it's about sex and relationships. i write about interabled couples which is a relationship between a disabled person and a non-disabled person.  &amp;#x200b;  # tips for making disability-inclusive content:  1. **normalize disability**. the script can include a few lines that demonstrate the character is disabled (whether it's a physical disability or not) **without** being a gigantic information dump about their disability. 2. avoid writing comfort and reassurance. as u/rightbitofkit explained very clearly [in her comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildaudio/comments/vpcfyn/comment/ieklzva/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), don't assume that every disabled person *wants* comfort/reassurance porn. being disabled is not necessarily ‚Äúthe great tragedy‚Äù of the character's life. don't pretend that their disability doesn't impact their life, but don't write ""inspiration porn"" either. 3. regarding fetishization: **do not** assume that everyone hates being fetishized. people from all paths of life, whether they are disabled or not, respond differently to fetishization. it is ableist to assume that all disabled people hate it. *devotee fetish* (acrotomophilia) and *amputee identity disorder* (apotemnophilia) are **not** inherently bad or wrong as long as you are aware of what it means, you are aware of whether or not you are fetishizing, and most importantly, you tag your content accurately. 4. learn what identity-first language, person-first language, and function labels are. **do not assume** that all disabled people prefer one over the other. just know what this means, and tag it if you use it. (i use the term ""disabled person"" in my scripts and some people strongly object to that. they want me to use ""person with a disability"" but i will not do that.) 5. learn what *ableism* is so you can avoid it. 6. read blogs and watch videos made by disabled people. listen to what they have to say about what sex and relationships are like for them and what type of content they are looking for.  however, like with anything else, remember that no one person, or group of people, can speak for everyone. 7. here are some communities to get you started: r/disabledsex, r/disablednudes, and r/spinalcordinjuries  üìö if you want to read my disability scripts:  * f4m, [head over wheels](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwascriptguild/comments/satba3/f4m_script_offer_head_over_wheels_adults/) (listener is a paraplegic) * f4m, [the squeaky wheel gets release](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwascriptguild/comments/ss9p3c/f4m_script_offer_the_squeaky_wheel_gets_release/) (listener is a paraplegic) * f4m, [paralyze this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwascriptguild/comments/suna74/f4m_script_offer_paralyze_this_adults_consensual/) (listener is a quadriplegic) * f4m, [all-wheel drive](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwascriptguild/comments/sxrzqb/f4m_script_offer_allwheel_drive_adults_consensual/) (listener has myotubular myopathy/xlmtm) * f4m: [cheerbreeder: gimme the d!](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwascriptguild/comments/t1vfi6/f4m_script_offer_cheerbreeder_gimme_the_d_adults/) (listener has cerebral palsy) * f4m: [bachelor of spine arts](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwascriptguild/comments/vs1cn7/f4m_script_offer_bachelor_of_spine_arts_adults/)  (listener has scheuermann‚Äôs kyphosis) * i haven't written m4f yet, and i haven't written a disabled speaker yet  &amp;#x200b;  if you want to see how other writers handle disability content, the first story that comes to mind is a f4a script, [you take my breath away](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwasapphic/comments/u50jin/tags_f4a_you_take_my_breath_away_sfw_restrictive/) by u/sapphospen_game.  &amp;#x200b;  i hope this is helpful to you.  &amp;#x200b;  christina üíô",1,,2

544550,"1. i can‚Äôt say physical dysphoria would or wouldn‚Äôt exist if gender didn‚Äôt exist but biological sex traits did because i have no point of reference. there‚Äôs no recorded history of such a culture with a record of a person with dysphoria. i won‚Äôt rule out the possibility of a person in such a culture feeling uncomfortable because they were born with a vagina and would be comfortable with a penis, but i can‚Äôt be sure.  2. i meant that the medical condition would still exist, but societies can be built in ways that a disabled person wouldn‚Äôt be considered to have ‚Äúspecial‚Äù needs and their needs would be seen as normal. for an example on a really small scale, i worked at an overnight camp for disabled kids, and the vast majority of the staff was also disabled. i was still paralyzed, my friends were still amputees/paralyzed/deaf, our boss was still deaf, and the kids still had cp/tbi/sci/autism/epilepsy/etc, but none of us were ‚Äúless able‚Äù there. the property and activities were accessible to physically disabled people, there were several people who could interpret for the deaf and hard of hearing kids and staff, and the kids with autism and down syndrome had their access needs met. in that little society, none of us were disabled in the social sense. i still couldn‚Äôt walk, but i wasn‚Äôt being stopped from participating fully like i am in my normal life.   compare that to mainstream society- there are a lot of places that lack proper ramps and accessible bathrooms. i have been denied access to jobs, public transportation, and educational opportunities because i wasn‚Äôt believed to be capable of handling the same things able-bodied people are expected to, even though i actually was capable. like my college won‚Äôt let me go on study abroad trips because i‚Äôm a ‚Äúliability‚Äù even though i‚Äôm completely capable of going. they‚Äôve also told me not to take asl or certain science labs, because my fingers are weak and they didn‚Äôt think i could handle the work. and there are entire buildings at my school that are ada-compliant but are still very difficult for me to navigate. i am kept from participating in those things by a society that has certain beliefs about people like me. a society that believes i can walk when i can‚Äôt won‚Äôt fix anything, but i would be far more ‚Äúabled‚Äù in a society that makes it possible for me to participate to my full capacity like everyone else.   so i think disability as a social construct works a lot like gender as a social construct. in one society, gender could be present but not be a defining characteristic of people. the people in that society wouldn‚Äôt be categorized by gender and assigned different roles and expectations accordingly. much like the disabled society i talked about. in another society, gender could be rigidly defined and used to categorize people and determine what they can and can‚Äôt do. societies decide what men and women can or can‚Äôt do and what masculine and feminine mean, just like they decide how abled a body should be to participate in society. those definitions depend on the context of society.",1,,1

903050,"&gt; i disagree with it being unethical to tell parents their is no hope for their children if they have severe developmental disabilities (i've seen cases of severe cp with severe mental retardation going through 12 years of public schooling). if the public is paying for a resource, there has to be cut offs, where the public won't support further throwing of good money after bad. i agree that children with downs can/should be socialized and that they can do menial jobs with training. but i don't think they need the current extensive training over 12 years that they get. currently in the lausd, a special education student costs 10x that of average student. as a society i think we need to figure out what the actual return on our tax dollars is versus spending to make parents feel better.  true to a point, however you should consider the fact that disabled persons, even severely, can still be educated to a point at a young age. i have a friend who has a relative that became developmentally disabled after an accident in their youth. back then there were no programs of which you speak, and thus was never educated. sadly said relative is incapable of learning new things and  living independently where as nearly every other person with the same (to even more severe) disabilities *are* capable because they received the education they needed early in their lives. no, they will never rise to the level of ""normal person"", but they are able to hold a simple job and take care of themselves with minimal-to-no assistance. in contrast, my friend's relative requires almost constant supervision and has almost an exclusive lock on their familial guardian's time (had my friend's family not stepped up, she would cost the state vastly more than is spent in special education for the care she requires).  so while the special education does somewhat go towards making the families feel better, teaching a mentally disabled person needs so much nuance that it pretty much requires a specialist. spending the money now to properly educate said individuals reduces the dependence they have on either immediate family or the state in the long term, freeing up resources for the more severe cases that regardless of educational attempts will never be independent.",1,,

920348,"in steven pinker's ""the stuff of thought"" there is a chapter about swear words (and tourettes). (you should really by that book [and ""the language instinct"", also by him] if you in any way have interest in your brain or language)  here i give you an excerpt of the pages 335-338 from said book by steven pinker:  &gt;[‚Ä¶] &gt; &gt;**swearing aloud, like hearing the swear words of others, taps the deeper and older parts of the brain. aphasia, a loss of articulate language, is typically caused by damage to the cortex and the underlying white matter along the horizontal cleft (the sylvian fissure) in the brain's left hemisphere. for almost as long as neurologists have studied aphasia, they have noticed that patients can retain the ability to swear. a case study of a british aphasic recorded him as repeatedly saying ""bloody hell,"" ""fuck off,"" ""fucking fucking hell cor blimey,"" and ""oh you bugger."" the neurologist norman geschwind studied an american patient whose entire left hemisphere had been surgically removed because of brain cancer. the patient couldn't name pictures, produce or understand sentences, or repeat polysyllabic words, yet in the course of a five-minute interview he said ""goddammit"" seven times, and ""god!"" and ""shit"" once apiece. &gt;the survival of swearing in aphasia suggests that taboo epithets are stored as prefabricated formulas in the right hemisphere. such formulas lie at the opposite end of a continuum from propositional speech, in which combinations of words express combinations of ideas according to grammatical rules. it's not that the right hemisphere contains a profanity module, but that its linguistic abilities are confined to memorized formulas rather than rule-governed combinations. a word is the quintessential memorized chunk, and in many people the right hemisphere has a respectable vocabulary of words, at least in comprehension. the right hemisphere also can sometimes store idiosyncratic counterparts to rule-governed forms such as irregular verbs. often it commands longer memorized formulas as well, such as song lyrics, prayers, conversation &gt;fillers like um, boy, and well yes, and sentence starters like / think and you can't.** &gt; &gt;**the right hemisphere may be implicated in swearing for another reason: it is more heavily involved in emotion, especially negative emotion. &gt;yet it may not be the cerebral cortex in the right hemisphere that initiates &gt;epithets but an evolutionary older brain structure, the basal ganglia.** &gt;the basal ganglia are a set of clusters of neurons buried deep in the front &gt;half of the brain. their circuitry receives inputs from many other parts of &gt;the brain, including the amygdala and other parts of the limbic system, &gt;and loops back to the cortex, primarily the frontal lobes. one of their functions is to package sequences of movements, or sequences of reasoning &gt;steps, into chunks that are available for further combining when we're &gt;learning a skill. another is to inhibit the execution of the actions packaged &gt;into these chunks. components of the basal ganglia inhibit one another, &gt;so damage to different parts can have opposite effects. degeneration of &gt;one part of the basal ganglia can cause parkinson's disease, marked by &gt;tremors, rigidity, and difficulty initiating movement. degeneration of another part can cause huntington's disease, resulting in chorea or uncontrolled movements. &gt; &gt;the basal ganglia, with their role as packagers and inhibitors of behavior, have been implicated in swearing by two trails of evidence. one is a &gt;case study of a man who suffered a stroke in the right basal ganglia, leaving him with a syndrome that is the mirror image of classic aphasia. he &gt;could converse fluently in grammatical sentences, but couldn't sing &gt;familiar songs, recite well-practiced prayers and blessings, or swear‚Äî &gt;even when the beginning of a curse was given to him and he only had to &gt;complete it. &gt; &gt;**the basal ganglia have a far more famous role in swearing, thanks to a &gt;syndrome that was obscure to most people until the 1980s, when it suddenly was featured in dozens of television plots: gilles de la tourette syndrome, tourette syndrome or tourette's for short. tourette syndrome is &gt;a poorly understood neurological condition linked to abnormalities, partly &gt;hereditary, in the basal ganglia.** as any couch potato knows, its most florid &gt;symptom is a vocal tic consisting of shouted obscenities, taboo ethnic &gt;terms, and other kinds of verbal abuse. this symptom is called coprolalia &gt;(dung speech), from a greek root also found in coprophilous (living in &gt;dung), coprophagy (feeding on dung), and coprolite (fossilized dinosaur &gt;poop). in fact coprolalia occurs in only a minority of people with tourette &gt;syndrome; the more common tics are blinks, twitches, throat-clearing &gt;sounds, and repeated words or syllables. &gt; &gt;coprolalia shows off the full range of taboo terms, and embraces similar &gt;meanings in different languages, suggesting that swearing really is a coherent neurobiological phenomenon. a recent literature review lists the following words from american tourette's patients, from most to least &gt;frequent:38 &gt; &gt;*fuck, shit, cunt, motherfucker, prick, dick, cocksucker, nigger, &gt;cockey, bitch, pregnant-mother, bastard, tits, whore, &gt;doody, penis, queer, pussy, coitus, cock, ass, bowel movement, fangu (fuck in italian), homosexual, screw, fag, faggot, schmuck, blow me, wop* &gt; &gt;patients may also produce longer expressions like goddammit, you fucking &gt;idiot, shit on you, and fuck your fucking fucking cunt. a list from spanish-speaking patients includes puta (whore), mierda (shit), cono (cunt), joder &gt;(fuck), maricon (fag), cojones (balls), hijo de puta (son of a whore), and &gt;hostia (host, the wafer in a communion ceremony). a list from japan includes sukebe (lecherous), chin chin (cock), bakatara (stupid), dobusu &gt;(ugly), kusobaba (shitty old woman), chikusho (son of a whore), and an &gt;empty space in the list discreetly identified as ""female sexual parts."" there &gt;has even been a report of a deaf sufferer of tourette's who produced ""fuck"" &gt;and ""shit"" in american sign language. &gt; &gt;people with tourette's experience their outbursts not as literally involuntary but as a response to an overpowering urge, much like an irresistible &gt;itch or a mounting desire to blink or yawn. this tug-of-war between an unwanted impulse and the forces of self-control is reminiscent of one of the &gt;symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) called horrific temptations‚Äîthe obsessive fear that one might do something awful such as shouting ""fire!"" in a crowded theater or pushing someone off a subway platform. &gt;like tourette's, which it often accompanies, ocd seems to involve an imbalance between the brake pedal and accelerator circuits in the basal ganglia. it suggests that one of the roles of the basal ganglia is to designate &gt;certain thoughts and desires as unthinkable‚Äîtaboo‚Äîin order to keep &gt;them in check. by tagging, encapsulating, and inhibiting these thoughts, &gt;the basal ganglia solve the paradox that you have to think the unthinkable &gt;in order to know what you're not supposed to be thinking‚Äîthe reason that &gt;people have trouble following the instruction ""don't think of a polar &gt;bear."" **ordinarily the basal ganglia can hide our bad thoughts and actions &gt;with a don't-go-there designation, but when they are weakened, the lockboxes and safety catches can break down, and the thoughts we tag as &gt;unthinkable or unsayable assert themselves.** &gt; &gt;**in unimpaired people, the so-called executive systems of the brain &gt;(comprising the prefrontal cortex and another part of the limbic system, &gt;the anterior cingulate cortex) can monitor behavior emanating from the &gt;rest of the brain and override it in midstream.** this may be the origin of &gt;the truncated profanities that we use in polite company and which serve as &gt;the strongest epithets that pass the lips of vicars and maiden aunts when &gt;they stub their toes. every one of the standard obscenities offers a choice of &gt;bowdlerized alternatives:40 &gt;

694361,"that is something that makes my blood boil a little bit. people who are in that category of disability are (at least in my state) basically never what is legally considered an adult. if they are cared for by family they have a legal guardian who makes decisions on they're behalf. like a child does (if their family can no longer care for them, or they have no family left, they become wards of the state and are put in group homes or a state run hospital).  so legally if someone were to have sex with them it counts as statutory rape. where things get muddy is when two disabled individuals who are physically pretty well functional, but moderately or severely mentally handicapped decide they want to have a baby. they aren't capable of giving consent, but they are capable of intercourse. i personally know a couple who are both mentally disabled. they live with his brother. the guardians of the two had decided to allow them to get married, providing that the woman was on birth control because if they had a baby they felt they couldn't care for it properly. the disabled couple decided to have a baby anyway after they were married. she went off her birth control pills and kept it a secret for a while when she got pregnant. the baby was born deaf, blind, mentally retarded (that is the official diagnosis) and had some severe deformities of pretty much every major organ. her birth parents obviously couldn't care for her properly, so another of their siblings adopted her. they then had the wife get a more permanent form of birth control (i think they went with the implant).  long story short, what are the rules for a case like this? should a sterilization have happened to prevent them ever conceiving, or should they have the right to reproduce, even though cps with certainly be involved and probably end up taking whatever children they have due to being unfit parents? or like in the case i mentioned where the parents are certain to pass on severe genetic disabilities? those are the reasons the family thought it would be a bad idea for them to have a child, and they were proven correct. so like i said, it can be a very muddy, messy situation, but down at the bare bones of the matter is the fact that if a parent without a is unable to care for a child properly, they are taken from them. so in a case where there is overwhelming evidence that any future child can not be properly cared for, should that person be allowed to procreate? i believe they shouldn't. it's cruel to allow a woman to go through a pregnancy just to inevitably have her child taken from her.",1,,-1
466368,"&gt;i do however disagree with the assertion that it's circular to approach things with the presupposition that having a disability is worse than not having a disability because from my understanding, disabilities are defined by their dysfunction. even if one can find a way to work around or build upon a disability, dysfunction is so central to the very concept of disability that i don't know how you could separate them.  this is in fact contested by many disabled people who argue that disability is not actually defined by dysfunction.   take deafness, for example. many deaf people deny that deafness is a form of dysfunction. how do you show that deafness is a dysfunction? there are two intuitive arguments, and neither succeeds on its face:  (1) it's a dysfunction because deaf people can't hear things as well as hearing people.   this argument doesn't work, because it would imply that humans with normal vision are disabled and have visual dysfunction because they can't see ultraviolet light or that short people have a dysfunction because they can't reach certain shelves that taller people can. the standard picked ('hearing people') needs to be justified, otherwise the simple lack of an ability is insufficient because it overgeneralizes.    (2)  it's a dysfunction because deaf people can't hear things as well as the species norm for humans.   this tries to address the shortcomings of the first argument by appealing to a concept of 'normal function'. being short (within the species norm) and not seeing ultraviolet are within the human norm for ability, so those don't constitute dysfunctions. but being deaf is not within the species norm, so we can distinguish it from those cases and characterize it as a dysfunction.   the issue here is that the concept of normal function has its own problems, though the issues are too complicated to summarize here. here is a highly influential paper arguing against it: https://hilo.hawaii.edu/~ronald/pubs/2000-against-normal-function.pdf  &gt;for instance, if someone has diabetes the dysfunction is that their body can't make it's own insulin and the workaround is to get insulin from an outside source; even if this person gained personal growth from the experience of having diabetes and they can live a functional life, the dysfunction remains.  diabetes is a disease, unlike deafness or cerebral palsy. as such, it's not a helpful case to consider when discussing what disability is or isn't because we'd need to do the extra work of distinguishing what aspects of it are characteristic of it as a disease and which aspects are characteristic of it as a disability. i challenge you to explain what the dysfunction of autism or deafness are rather than diabetes (bearing in mind the problems with the two arguments i presented above).  &gt;additionally, the impacts of that dysfunction can be very clearly seen when you look at the large scale outcomes of people in these populations. children with migraines miss many more days of school than their peers and report worse educational outcomes, people with asd suffer depression about four times as often as neurotypicals, and in general people with disabilities are much more likely to live in poverty. &gt;some of these are due to the dysfunction itself and some of these are due to the stigma and environment surrounding that dysfunction. you can either alter the dysfunction (treatment) or you can alter the environment (acceptance). both acceptance and treatment are attempts to dampen the impact of the dysfunction and i don't think that either should be applied to the exclusion of the other.  rather than making general claims about how we should exclude neither, it seems more productive to consider carefully in more specific detail which approach is best suited to specific negative effects and specific disabilities based on what seems to be the proximate cause of those negative effects. and in the case of autism and many disabilities, the vast majority of negative effects (though not all negative effects) have proximate causes that are social.  this makes it much closer to something like race (or at least the skin tones used to classify races) than diabetes. certainly there are negative effects of autism that have internal proximate causes (higher vulnerability to epilepsy, for example), in the same way that there are certain negative effects of being white (higher vulnerability to skin cancer) or black (higher vulnerability to vitamin d deficiency). and if those negative effects can be treated, great. but there's a big difference between a treatment (sunscreen, vitamin d supplements) and a cure.  i think it's clear why when the vast majority of negative effects of being a certain way result from social stigma and discrimination, a cure is the wrong approach. the vast majority of negative effects of being black have social causes, and we shouldn't be talking about how we should leave both options on the table and work on developing a cure for blackness (even for 'those who want it').   &gt;people with disabilities are just people and like everybody else they can be overly defensive about their conceptions of the world and come to erroneous conclusions about themselves and others. the explanation that i gave was only one of many that i'm sure can explain this behavior pattern.  yes, but looking at the overall testimony of people with a certain condition is important here. the vast majority of diabetics want a cure and medical treatment. the majority of autistic people don't. it seems like the best default explanation of this is that diabetes and autism are importantly different, and that autistic people's reasons for not wanting a cure - that the main causes of autistic suffering are social, that there are important parts of being autistic that can be valuable and beneficial - are probably based on an accurate understanding of autism since autistic people are the ones with the most experience of it.   elizabeth barnes' book *the minority body* has an excellent and extended treatment of how to handle the testimony of disabled people as well as some of the other issues that have come up in our discussion, if you have an interest in reading much more polished and detailed arguments for the positions i'm advancing.",1,,1

279094,"sometimes i feel like i‚Äôve watched so much tv in my life that i‚Äôve done irreparable damage, to my dna, like i‚Äôve corrupted the very core of who i am, or who i would have been had i not spent so much time in front of the television. one particular way in which i can measure how my soul has been diminished is my reaction to real life tragedy. tv, especially the reruns that i grew up with, has desensitized me. i‚Äôm incapable of feeling any sincere amount of empathy when horrible things happen to those around me.  right before my grandfather died, he was diagnosed with macular degeneration, fated to slowly going blind, unable to see the world in which he was soon no longer to be a part of. everybody took the news really hard. all of my aunts and uncles and cousins got together, to be close, to mourn the closing of a chapter in our family‚Äôs history. people put on a brave face, but there was definitely an underlying sorrow, thinking about my once active grandfather, now no longer able to drive anywhere, soon he wouldn‚Äôt be able see anything at all.  and all i could think of was, well, the fonz went blind on an episode of happy days. i forget the specifics, but i think something happened where potsy smacked fonzie in the head with a frying pan, and for the rest of the episode, he couldn‚Äôt see a thing. doctors told mr. fonzerelli that, unfortunately, the damage was permanent, that he‚Äôd just have to get used to being blind, for the rest of his life. the word forever was tossed around at least five times.  everybody tried to act upbeat while the fonz wallowed in self-loathing. he tried showing up at that burger joint hoping everything would be the same, until he went over to where he thought the jukebox was, to try that trick where he‚Äôd save a quarter by hitting the machine and it would just start playing. but he was blind, so he accidentally hit ralph in the stomach. things got quiet before ralph tried to break the awkward silence by making some jukebox sound effects.  but the fonz was pissed. everything wasn‚Äôt the same. his life as he knew it was over. or was it? it wasn‚Äôt. it turns out that the doctor was reading somebody else‚Äôs test results, that fonzie‚Äôs blindness would only be temporary. i wonder how the other patient reacted to the doctor‚Äôs mix-up, ‚Äúi‚Äôm sorry sir, i know i told you that you‚Äôd be back to normal in no time, but it turns out i made a mistake. you‚Äôll be blind forever.‚Äù  what, were they really going to make the fonz blind in every subsequent episode of happy days? no, the fonz was blind, for a minute, he dealt with it, or didn‚Äôt deal with it, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, because stuff like that never really happens on tv anyway. and i watched tons of crap like this growing up. so i couldn‚Äôt help not feeling bad for my grandfather, because even though everybody kept stressing that macular degeneration was incurable, i just kept waiting for that doctor to show up, ‚Äúsorry for the misunderstanding, folks,‚Äù my grandfather would be like, ‚Äúhey doc. no problem. aaaay.‚Äù  it‚Äôs like my grandmother. she spent a good chunk of her life in a wheelchair thanks to multiple sclerosis. again, that‚Äôs a really serious condition, and i‚Äôm sure it was the cause of a significant amount of pain and suffering. but as hard as i tried to face my grandmother‚Äôs reality, i could never shake that episode of star trek: the next generation where lieutenant worf got crushed by a giant shipping container in cargo bay two.  an accident like that would have killed a mere human, but worf‚Äôs a klingon, and klingons are tough, so he survived. but he didn‚Äôt make it out totally unscathed: his spine looked more like a jigsaw puzzle now, and he was left a quadriplegic. the honor bound security chief was devastated. his life as he knew it was gone forever. what of his duties on the enterprise? over.  the klingon code of honor didn‚Äôt help much either. apparently disabled klingons are expected to commit ritualistic suicide. only worf couldn‚Äôt move his hands, so he asked commander riker to do it for him. but do the twenty-forth century ethics of the united federation of planets allow for assisted suicide? and what of worf‚Äôs young son alexander? so many hard questions. so much irreversible loss.  luckily, right after worf chose to stick it out, to give life a chance, doctor crusher heard of this brand new experimental klingon spine restoring operation. it had never been tried out before, but it just might work. what followed was a pretty suspenseful five-minute surgery scene and, guess what? it worked. worf was back to normal. was it too much to expect something like this in real life? why couldn‚Äôt doctors come up with an experimental ms procedure for my grandmother? why are you doing this to me, tv?  do television shows think they‚Äôre teaching audiences a lesson by having their characters overcome impossible situations? are we supposed to learn from their experiences dealing very briefly with chronic disease and permanent disability? no, we‚Äôre all getting ruined, our ability to cope with trauma eroded by cheap writing and loose plot holes.  charles in charge gets hit in the head and instead of suffering brain damage turns into a badass biker named chaz. michelle tanner comes down with amnesia, but don‚Äôt worry, uncle jessie and the gang help jog her memory with a best-of full house video montage. this is the fantasy world in which our generation grew up, where all tumors wind up being benign, and where all cancer scares are inevitably the mistaken results of some radiologist made at the beginning of the episode. thanks a lot tv.",1,,2

""i'll save you and poor grandpa!"", says government. ""my hero!"", say mom &amp; dad. everyone lives happily ever after. here's the problem: government is largely incompetent. we should know this. we elect the stupid fuckers, and keep electing them knowing they are largely incapable of doing their job. then we bitch when they don't do their job properly. the same is true in this meat plant situation. have you ever asked someone in at the meat counter in your grocery store or butcher shop where they get their meat? if you haven't you have no one to blame but yourself. don't trust the government to do it for you. you already know they're incompetent. granted, this can be a difficult task. it's a matter of how far you want to take it. it's a matter of how deeply you want to look into the multitude of issues that confront our daily lives. it's a matter of where you draw your own line in the sand and start looking for truth and facts. it's a matter of which companies have earned your trust. make them earn it, people. don't hand it out like it's and opinion. sorry for the rant.",1,,0

378664,"no one is entitled to go to medical school. the ada only mandates ""reasonable accommodations"" be made in any situation. someone who is severely visually impaired or blind frankly can't do the majority of things required of a physician. it is what it is. there are no blind pilots or mute opera singers.   if someone's epilepsy is controlled and doesn't suddenly spiral out of control when they face the physical demands of residency, that's great and they should pursue whatever training they want. if you have a disability that might be aggravated by training you should think about that when making your decision. residency is not a right and hospitals are allowed to terminate if you can't uphold your contract. it may be possible to reduce hours and extend training but that's not always an option. the paralyzed surgery resident's program defended their decision by stating they didn't have the caseload necessary for her to meet the required number of cases if they were to let her return with the class below her-that's the same argument programs would use to rightfully defend not expanding their class size.   here's what i mean about concrete disability-none of the symptoms listed in the medscape article are things that a significant number of people might experience once in a while if they were working 80 hours a week-dizziness, nausea, balance problems, etc. no matter how much i work i never become blind or paraplegic but i don't know about you? those issues are hard to quantify or prove. i don't think it's unreasonable to say there's correlation between the merit of an ada appeal and whether it's granted. those things are decided by committees with extensive training and much more information than we have. you really don't think a more valid issue isn't more likely to be granted than an invalid one? i didn't say her specific appeal was in no was possibly merited but i did supply information from the medscape article about what has happened in her situation thus far.  asking for a schedule modification is one thing, demanding it is another. uva has every right to say she's not fulfilling her employee contract and that it's not possible to make the accommodations she is requesting due to the needs of their patients.    thanks for concluding i have no idea what i'm talking about. almost everything i've stated is factual information about her situation or the circumstances of others. how you feel about it is irrelevant. seems like she bit of more than she could chew and now expects everyone to accommodate her without considering how those requests affect her co-residents or patients.",1,,-1

945672,"one of the biggest problems is, most american children are segregated from kids with physical disabilities. most of us grow up never meeting a deaf or blind person, let alone sharing a class with them, and kids who need special equipment to get around, like oxygen tanks and wheelchairs go to completely different public schools (unless it's one of those smaller districts where the school system can't afford it, then you have the ""special ed"" kids segregated in a basement dungeon somewhere lumped in with autistic and downs syndrome kids and other intellectually disabled kids. and you can imagine how they feel about that...)  at my old junior high, a woman threatened to sue because they were trying to force her little person daughter to be in special ed. they were trying to be all 'it's for her own safety so she doesn't get bullied!' but mom insisted, they relented, and the girl was able to get in with a clique real fast and no one even teased her beyond the ""hey shawty!"" and ""oh, grow up already!"" stuff.  so i do blame the education system for this a lot. they work under the assumption that they are protecting these kids from bullying (or themselves from lawsuits) and i also want to think that they have a game-plan of educating these kids in a better way (though i have no proof of that) but they really end up making these kids invisible and alien to everyone else.   i really don't have a solution because i have no clue what's going on behind-the-doors at departments of education around the country so my suggestions would all be naive ""well, why don't you just..."" stuff. but as writers, we can definitely do the research and include well-written, accurate, disabled characters or all kinds in our books.  but just a personal nitpick, i do worry that not many readers will rush out to buy a ""hi my name is doris and i have elephantitis"" book. a chapter or two of watching doris live her life with elephantitis might be interesting... but then what?

250277,"here is the response given by one of my mentors in ayurvedic medicine to the question of insulin dependent diabetes:  &gt;just as there is a way to become diabetic, there is a way to reverse it. the notion that diabetis is a disease, which implies that the body is making a mistake or is doing a poor job, is fundamentally false. the body is not out to destroy itself, nor does it find any pleasure in making its host feel miserable. instead, the body tries all that it can to protect itself from further harm than what has been caused by inadequate nourishment and a detrimental lifestyle.  &gt;if the body's cells are running out of major nutients (proteins, sugar, fats) because there is not enough insulin available to transport them to the cells, it would make sense to the layperson and his doctor alike to inject insulin into the blood so that the insulin can resume this essential task and remove the sugar, fat and protein molecules from the blood. however, without asking why the body is being put into this akward position, just feeding it with insulin is not getting rid of the imbalance, but quite to the contrary, increase the risk of other calamities. the higher risks for heart disease, cancer, stroke, blindness and alzheimer's, etc. among diabetics, etc. are widely known.  &gt;one of the misleading directions that diabetics have been given for decades is to reduce carbohydrates (and instead eat mostly proteins), since the sugars they contain would raise the blood sugar and endanger their lives. it is obvious that refined, manufactured carbohydrates affect everyone's health, not just diabetics. what the patients are not being told is that the amount of insulin needed for a piece of steak is way more than the amount needed to process 1/2 pound of pure white sugar. since the pancreas cells are uanble to come up with that amount of insulin (even in a healthy body), the unused protein ends up becoming deposited in the connective tissues, from where it is taken up by the basal membranes of the blood capillary walls. eventually, the basal membranes have accumulated so much protein that, even simple sugars cannot be pass through them. hence, they remain trapped in the blood.  &gt;the pancreas realizes this through intricate feedback mechanisms and cell enzyme messages. putting more insulin in the blood at his stage would be suicidal, because too much insulin in the body causes cancer, especially pancreatic cancer and colon cancer. consequently, the pancreas has to destroy or put to sleep a large number of its insulin-producing cells.  &gt;it is obvious, that this act of cancer-preventive self-preservation means that there is not enough insulin around to transport the sugar out of the blood stream. doctors call this miraculous feat of survival a disease, and they continue to give their patients the advice to eat lots of protein foods. i have had insulin-dependent patients become vegan, and within less than 6 weeks show no more signs of diabetes, for the first time in 20 years.  &gt;chronic disease is only chronic as long as its causes are still intact. insulin injection is the very thing that keeps the patient from recovering. it forces the pancreas to destroy even more insulin-producing cells. there a plenty of natural things that can replace injection with insulin. just one teaspoon of ground cinnamon per day can balance blood sugar. tumeric is an amazing herb/spice with a simialr effect. broccoli, and other vegetables have, as well as regular full body exposure to sunlight (vitamin d-generating) have superior blood sugar-regulating effects than insulin injections have.  &gt;astaining from proteins foods, cleansing the liver of stones (gallstones are another leading cause of diabetis, see details in the amazing liver cleanse, ener-chi.com, eating a balanced diet and living a balanced lifestyle are much more effective means of restoring normal functions in the body than just trying to fix one symptom of disease and still not become healthy.  &gt;by taking responsibility for his own health, and therefore his life, he has the opportunity to put the sweetness back into his life, which he has lost so long ago. i am glad that you are also gifting him with my book freedom from judgment. he will learn how important it is fro his healing process to let go of the need for judgment in his life. i wish him the very best.",1,,1
